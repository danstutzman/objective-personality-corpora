- For those of you who don't know,
Tilman was named by Forbes as the richest
restaurateur in the world,
but near and dear to my heart,
you own a basketball team,
which is probably the,
probably the greatest accomplishment,
in my mind, somebody
could do for just a fun
business goal, owns 600 restaurants,
60,000 employees.
- Yeah, five casinos, but I have to say,
I love 'em all, I love all the businesses
and the hotels, but
it's really great owning
a basketball team.
- Basketball team, that's as good,
and you've got a good team this year.
