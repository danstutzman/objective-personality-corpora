daily shots; she has not stopped.
tell us how illness made you stronger. I have juvenile diabetes
and I was diagnosed at seven and a half
years old. I suspect and I think I know
that any child who has a chronic disease
of any kind learns two things
from that disease: discipline because you
have to
become disciplined in taking care of
yourself
in order to survive and creativity.
Raised in a Puerto Rican family in the
Bronx with the help of a devoted grandmother,
she taught herself how to sterilize
needles for her own insulin injections
to keep from relying on feuding parents
with marital problems.
My mom and dad had their challenges
my dad as I described in my book, was an
alcoholic
and his drinking created a great deal
of friction in our home
he and my mom argued a lot. My
grandmother was my haven of safety
and so I loved going to see her, I knew
that my grandmother
couldn't give me a shot and if I wanted
to stay with her,
I needed to do it myself. Her father died
when she was 9.
I watched my mother for a year be deeply,
deeply depressed and I was actually very
worried about losing her too
and when she finally came out of her
depression, I was relieved
and that started a new road in our lives
a road that lead Sonia Sotomayor to becoming a great student.
She gave me something
very very important
she taught me
the value of education. For my
mother,
education came before everything else
in her and our lives. She scrimped and
saved
to send us to Catholic school, my brother
and I because it was
better than the local public schools in
the poor neighborhood I was growing up in.
She saved to buy an encyclopedia Britannica for us.                          
We were the only kids in the projects that had books that were so rich with information
I remember sitting and opening up a book
almost every week I would take a book
and explore it.
