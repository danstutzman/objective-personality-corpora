a confirmation of a justice
or-or-or what do you think
the most important qualities
of a judge have to be?
Because it is, you know,
one of the highest positions
you can possess in the land.
Uh...
I'm gonna answer that
differently.
I'm going to answer a question
you haven't asked
but I think
is much more important.
What should you possess
as a citizen?
-Hmm.
-And I think that,
in this roomful of people,
if I ask every non-lawyer
in the room,
and maybe some lawyers,
how many Supreme Court decisions
have you read
from beginning to end,
no one will raise their hand.
All the news people get
is from the newspapers
or television.
-The sound bite.
-Right.
-You know, the headline.
-Yes.
This side won.
This side lost.
But nobody talks
about the reasoning.
Very few people do.
They'll quote a sentence here,
a sentence there.
But I think if you're gonna be
an informed person,
you should really read
the decisions.
Because that's
where both sides--
if there are two sides;
court agrees a lot,
-so it's not that every case
is split. -Right.
But those that are,
you should read both sides.
To understand
which arguments were applied
-and why they were applied.
-Exactly.
