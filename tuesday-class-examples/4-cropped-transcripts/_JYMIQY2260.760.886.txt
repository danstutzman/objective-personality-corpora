I'm a big believer that's all.
But now I'm not worried
about how much sleep they get.
I'm worried about what
they do while they're awake.
- Okay but the two
things are connected.
Because if you wake up fully
recharged it means you wake up
ready to take on the world.
You know that feeling?
You wake up you say,
"Come on, bring it on."
It doesn't matter how many
obstacles, challenges, setbacks.
- I prefer those things.
- Okay. Perfect.
Travis is a friend of yours.
- Yes.
- I just joined
the board of Uber.
Travis has a little bit of that.
- Yes.
- He may be dealing with 30
crisis at the same time--
- He eats it for lunch.
- What happens and here's the
key you just put something on
your Facebook yesterday 
that I loved which is
it's ultimately just business.
- That's it.
- It is not life-and-death.
- That's right.
- People who have a hard time
are the people who basically
make it too important.
Perspective is everything.
And that's really what
Stoic philosophers believe.
You know who is my greatest
hero other than you Gary?
- Yes?
- I'll pick a dead person.
Is Marcus Aurelius.
I'll tell you why he
was the Emperor of Rome.
Pretty big job, you agree?
- Yes, the job.
- Right in the arena
dealing with invasions,
plagues, everything.
And he was also a
Stoic philosopher.
And literally
nothing ever got to him.
He wrote a book about it.
He called meditations and I have
by my bed and every time I'm
beginning to get anxious about
something or worried I look at
that book and the fact that
he considered life as though
everything that happened
was a hidden blessing.
- I agree with that.
- I don't know why, I don't
know how but another favorite of
mine, Rum,i the Persian poet,
he said live life as though
everything is
rigged in your favor.
- I think optimism
is the ultimate drug.
- And we don't know.
We don't really know enough
about what's happening in life
so whatever happens for me some
of my biggest heartbreaks led to
my biggest moments of joy
and happiness and success.
- India. I love that Arianna.
I love that.
I believe that stuff so much.
