how you tend to worry and let me give
you example I'm a married man he grabs
me this is a woman that I'm attracted to
so I'm in school serving my boys and I
know she a fine looking teacher right I
tried to stay here and be a strong man
because I like the attention but I know
this blow was coming between the bone in
my face what if my wife sees this what
if I get hit and now I'm in the car with
her so what we tend to do is men we stay
here cuz we strong we stay fighting and
we did knocked out when what we should
do when the woman grabs and she comes
that Boko up come underneath and I could
hit him walking turning this way control
