in them at the time.
How do you create such in-depth storylines and plots?
Like how does it come to your head?
Well
you can get the idea for a novel in
quite a short period of time but then
you have to sit down and work at it.
so what they say is 10% inspiration and
90% perspiration so the rest of it is
working it out and while you're working
it out you often get more and different
and new ideas because the idea that you
may have originally started with isn't
working out quite the way you thought it
might so your biggest friend as a
novelist is your waste paper basket. You
throw the things that aren't working
unless you think there's something you
might use later in which case you save
it and that could be a long process it
can take you know a year two years to
work out an idea that you might have had
in five minutes so we don't know where
ideas come from they - can come from
anywhere really
but it's the working out of it that
makes it involved and when you're
working you know you're looking at
you're looking at structure and you're
looking at pacing.
