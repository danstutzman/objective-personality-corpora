because we, at the moment,
have had brilliant leaders
in business, in finance, in politics,
making terrible decisions.
So a high IQ does not mean
that you're a good leader,
because the essence of leadership
is being able to see the iceberg
before it hits the Titanic.
(Laughter)
And we've had far too many icebergs
hitting our Titanics.
In fact, I have a feeling
that if Lehman Brothers
was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,
they might still be around.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
While all the brothers were busy
just being hyper-connected 24/7,
maybe a sister would have
noticed the iceberg,
because she would have woken up
from a seven-and-a-half-
or eight-hour sleep,
and have been able to see the big picture.
