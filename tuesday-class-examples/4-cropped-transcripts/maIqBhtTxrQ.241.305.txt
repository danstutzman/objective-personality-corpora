I'd like to pretend that there's a more
delicate way of putting it but I just
don't think there is that's what it is
it's us if you live in those states then
your senator voted that people who on
the terrorist watch list should be
allowed to ABAI assault rifles so call
or email or tweet at them and just tell
them you're not cool with that and I
know it seems small but don't let them
convince you that you're small because a
lot of small things coming together can
do big things and are big things a lot
of small moments matter
we can't keep killing ourselves and each
other we don't have to do this let's not
lose anybody anymore
