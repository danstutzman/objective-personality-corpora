it's fine
[Music]
it impacted me in that it made me from a
very beginning I mean just deciding to
take on the role meant that I was going
outside of my comfort zone and gonna
push myself to do things that were I
don't know things that I never thought
that I could do whether it was dead
lifting or learning martial arts things
like that well those are all very new
for me I don't know I have no
expectations how it impacts people you
know I don't really I don't really know
I don't really feel like it's up to me
oh you came back you came back to me why
is that so satisfying
I feel like accepted and understood and
seeing oh that's an expensive shoe hmm
