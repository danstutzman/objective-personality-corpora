I didn't have to sell
my company to buy them.
- Do you have to be careful to balance,
you've got all this other business
and the Rockets just
natural to want to just
focus all day on that?
- Yeah, but this goes back to once again,
something I talk about, I know what I know
and I know what I don't know.
And so I really can't contribute
at the Rocket's office everyday.
'Cause I'm not gonna scout players,
I'm not gonna tell you who to pick.
Sure, could I have a little effect talking
about the business side
and sponsors and expenses
and all that?
Sure, I might have a little bitty effect,
but I still get up everyday
and go to my other office
and I never use my office at the Rockets.
'Cause I just can't contribute enough
to make a difference there.
