problem but like if it was like your
family I mean I've had issues with your
family right like we've all had this
we've had issues with each other's
families but like where I start to feel
uncomfortable or I feel a little
attacked I go quiet because in in
retaliating or pushing back or even
calling someone in because you may have
every right to I may push back but now
the other person gets super upset and it
just becomes a drama right the entire
day the entire lunch whatever it just
becomes awkward cuz everyone in the room
feels it so even if you're right even if
I have every reason because somebody's
been unreasonable towards me everyone
saw that this person has been
unreasonable towards me retaliating only
makes that situation worse and when it's
a family event I just wouldn't do it
did you hear me say retaliate but you're
saying if you you calling someone on it
yes do you know how far somebody has to
push or I'm just saying even that and
can so let's let's analyze the behavior
so now take it out of the abstract
make it real so look at how I have dealt
with the friction that and which by the
way has been minor but like the friction
that I've ever dealt with from your side
of the family and the friction that
you've dealt with from my side of the
family
I'm always no one would ever know that I
feel any friction no one ever zero
I don't like extreme but they know that
you feel the friction because it's not
like you're quiet is invisible you're
quiet is a statement yes yes okay
so whether you we've been in situations
where people have visibly got annoyed at
me and it made situations uncomfortable
yes always I don't think anyone in my
family's done that to you
do you know why because I know how to
let it roll off my back and you don't
hmm and this is this is a truth of our
humanity so things wind you up and I
don't let them wind me up and I
