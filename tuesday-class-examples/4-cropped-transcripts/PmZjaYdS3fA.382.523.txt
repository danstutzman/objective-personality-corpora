[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Jimmy: DO YOU EVER REGRET 
ANYTHING YOU SAY?
OR IS IT JUST -- YOU LOOK AT IT 
LIKE, HEY, I PUT IT OUT THERE, 
IT'S OUT THERE, THERE'S NO POINT
IN REGRETTING IT?
>> I THINK PEOPLE FOCUS TOO MUCH
ON THE PAST AND FOCUS TOO MUCH 
ON REGRET.
EVEN LIKE WHEN YOU DEAL WITH 
SCHOOLS.
LIKE YOU TAKE LIKE THE SLAVE 
IDEA.
MY POINT IS, I'VE HEARD OF 
HISTORY CLASS.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A CLASS THAT
BREAKS DOWN HOW YOU, YOU KNOW, 
BALANCE A CHECKBOOK OR HOW YOU 
CONTROL YOUR FINANCES, WHICH MY 
FATHER NEVER TAUGHT ME THAT.
AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A FUTURE
CLASS.
SO THEY KEEP US SO FOCUSED ON 
HISTORY THAT WE START TO BELIEVE
THAT IT ACTUALLY REPEATS ITSELF.
AND WE BECOME OVERLY 
TRADITIONAL.
AND WE CAN'T ADVANCE AS A RACE 
OF BEINGS.
WE GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE PAST
AND WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING AND 
WHAT EVERYONE'S TWEETING.
AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO 
BE FEARLESS ENOUGH TO BREAK THE 
[ BLEEP ] SIMULATION.
WHEN I SAY SIMULATION, THAT'S 
WHAT I MEAN BY Sâ™ªIMULATION.
SORRY, I KNOW YOU GUYS WANTED TO
CLAP BUT EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO
SAY IS GOING TO BE AMAZING.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HERE'S THE IDEA WHY YOU'RE IN A 
SIMULATION.
LET'S START WITH ACTING, FIRST 
OF ALL.
A 2-YEAR-OLD SCREAMS AT A 
RESTAURANT, THE ENTIRE 
RESTAURANT SCREAMS, TEACH THAT 
KID HOW TO ACT.
WE'RE ALL UNPAID ACTORS IN SOME 
GIANT SCRIPT THAT WE DIDN'T 
WRITE.
SIMULATION.
A 2-YEAR-OLD JUMPS ON A COFFEE 
TABLE AND SOMEONE SAYS, THAT'S A
COFFEE TABLE, DON'T JUMP ON 
THAT.
SO IT WENT FROM BEING SOMETHING 
THAT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE 
SUPERMAN, HE'S GOT HIS CAPE ON, 
TO SOMETHING WHERE HE HAS TO 
THINK ABOUT IN THE PERSON'S LIKE
A FAMILY MEMBER, HE'S 2 YEARS 
OLD, DOESN'T GIVE A [ BLEEP ] 
ABOUT A COFFEE OR A TABLE.
HE'S STARTING TO LIKE CALCULATE 
ALL THESE THINGS.
BY THE TIME YOU'RE 40 YEARS OLD 
YOU'VE GOT A WALL FULL OF COFFEE
TABLES CALCULATING YOU INTO 
CLA
TRAFFIC, CALCULATING YOU INTO 
YOUR CAREER CHOICE, CALCULATING 
YOU INTO THIS TOWNHOUSE THAT'S 
NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE 
TOWNHOUSE NEXT AND IT JUST NEVER
WORKS.
THAT'S THE SIMULATION THAT I'M
