But the point is that it is
absolutely critical to realize
that we have been living
under a collective delusion.
I have to say that.
We are now where we were in
the 60s regarding smoking.
The science was in but people
were still glamorizing smoking
and there were doctors I saw an
ad that the other day from the
60's of a doctor in a white
coat saying, "I smoke menthols
"because they 
refresh my throat."
