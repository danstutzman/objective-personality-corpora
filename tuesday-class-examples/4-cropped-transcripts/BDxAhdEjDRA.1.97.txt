>> Jimmy: HOW ARE YOU. 
>> THIS IS AMAZING. 
>> Jimmy: WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES
I'M SO GLAD YOU OPENED A 
RESTAURANT HERE.
BY THE WAY I WAS TALKING ABOUT 
REVIEWS TO JASON BATEMAN, ON 
ROTTEN TOMATOES DO YOU PAY 
ATTENTION TO YOUR RESTAURANT 
REVIEWS. 
>> UNFORTUNATELY I'M A BIT 
OBSESSED WITH THEM. 
>> Jimmy: DO YOU FEEL YOU GET 
GOOD FEEDBACK. 
>> IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO GET GOOD
FEEDBACK.
IT HURTS WHEN YOU GET SOMETHING 
NEGATIVE BUT KEEP YOUR EYE OUT 
FOR BIGS FOOD CRITICS. 
>> WHEN A FOOD CRITIC COMES INTO
YOUR RESTAURANT DO YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE THERE. 
>> YES.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES YOU
MIGHT MISS THEM BUT YOU NEVER 
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.
BUT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY TRAINING 
A FACEBOOK OF WHO IS COMING IN 
AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU 
GET THEM FOR SURE. 
>> Jimmy: SO THE WAITERS KNOW. 
>> EVERYONE IS GETTING TRAINED 
ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. 
>> Jimmy: REALLY. 
>> YOU WANT A PROTOCOL SO 
THEY'RE NOT NERVOUS WHEN THEY DO
COME IN. 
>> Jimmy: DO THEY KNOW YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE THERE. 
>> THERE'S A CHINESE WALL IN 
AMERICA I ALWAYS FELT EVEN IF I 
KNOW THE CRITIC YOU DON'T GO TO 
THE TABLE HEY GOOD TO MEET YOU 
AGAIN. 
>> Jimmy: GOING TO BLOW THE 
WHOLE THING. 
>> KEEP IT SEPARATE. 
>> Jimmy: BUT YOU MAKE SURE THEY
GET A GOOD MEAL. 
>> THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR 
AUDIENCE OR SOMEONE HEARING 
THIS.
YOU REALLY WANT EVERYONE TO GET 
THE SAME MEAL. 
>> Jimmy: YEAH. 
>> BUT IF PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME 
IN TO EAT THEY WOULD GET A 
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. 
>> Jimmy: RIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CAME IN WOULD GET A BUCKET OF 
CHICKEN. 
>> YES.
