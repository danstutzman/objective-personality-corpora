Well, the greatest challenge I faced
through this whole process,
it wasn't the protests against my film,
and it wasn't how I was treated
by the mainstream media -
even though it got
pretty disgusting at times.
The greatest challenge I faced
was peeling back the layers
of my own bias.
It turns out I did meet
my enemy while filming.
It was my ego saying that I was right,
and they were subhuman.
It's no secret now that I no longer
call myself a feminist,
but I must clarify I am not anti-feminist,
and I am not a men's rights activist.
I still support women's rights,
and I now care about men's rights as well.
However,
I believe if we want
to honestly discuss gender equality,
we need to invite all voices to the table.
Yet, this is not what is happening.
Men's groups are continually vilified,
falsely referred to as hate groups,
and their voices
are systematically silenced.
Do I think either movement
has all the answers?
No.
Men's rights activists
are not without flaws,
neither are feminists.
But if one group is being silenced,
that's a problem for all of us.
If I could give advice to anyone
in our society at large,
we have to stop expecting to be offended,
and we have to start truly,
openly, and sincerely listening.
That would lead
to a greater understanding
of ourselves and others,
having compassion for one another,
working together towards solutions
because we all are in this together.
And once we do that,
we can finally heal from the inside out.
But it has to start with listening.
Thank you for listening.
