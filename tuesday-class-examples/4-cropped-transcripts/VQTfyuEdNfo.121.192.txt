[Ethan] Yeah, nice to meet you.
[Tai] Interuppting my- my reading. This is my cliff notes.
[Ethan] What you got there?
[Tai] Cliff notes a day!
[Ethan] First of all,
thanks for inviting us out here.
[Tai] Ah, no problem.
[Ethan] I know we-we-
I-I-I respect, you know,
I respect that.
[Tai] Yeah.
[Ethan] I think it's awesome.
[Tai] "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer" they say.
[Ethan] Yeah, for sure.
[Ethan] What, did you read that in a book?
[Tai] Cliff notes only.
[Ethan] That's all.
[Tai] Should I take you out in the Lambo?
[Ethan] Yeah!
[Tai] What do you think? 
[Ethan] Most definitely.
[Tai] Are you a good driver?
[Ethan] No.
[Ethan] But I'll drive it.
[Tai] Nah, then I'll drive.
[Ethan] So, this is your house?
[Tai] This is my Zillow place.
Air- this is my AirBnB.
This is air-
I started telling people after a video,
I was like, you know what?
AirBnB,
you can rent it from me,
ten thousand a night.
[Ethan] So, let-let me get this straight.
[Tai] okay?
[Ethan] This is your house?
[Tai] So, this house-
because there's been a lot of controversy if this is my house or not,
this is a house that I do through my business.
It's not a rental.
[Ethan] It's owned?
[Tai] It's-it's a lease.
A lot of the World,
I think, is in a bubble.
So, you start buying Realestate.
If you want to be poor,
buy high,-
[Ethan] Okay, Tai, hold on.
This isn't one of your infomercials.
[Ethan] Come on, dude.
[Tai] Oh. okay-
[Ethan] Okay?
[Tai] My bad, I got-I-I got a little excited, I guess.
[Ethan] We're just hanging out, dude.
[Ethan] We're just chillin' here.
