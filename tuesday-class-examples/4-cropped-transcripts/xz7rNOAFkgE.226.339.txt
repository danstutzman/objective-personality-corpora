[Kamala Harris] Okay.
[Mindy Kaling] That's a fine chop.
[Kamala Harris] Right.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, Senator Harris,
I say this with respect,
you're kind of a show off.
(laughing)
It's like, meanwhile it's taking me
20 minutes to do this much ginger.
Okay, what can't she do?
You got my vote.
So your mom worked and my
mom worked, but my mom also--
[Kamala Harris] I know, your mother was a doctor.
[Mindy Kaling] Well, interesting
thing about Indian women
of a certain generation,
is you had to do both.
[Kamala Harris] Yeah, oh yeah.
[Mindy Kaling] Right.
Like my mom would wake
up at five in the morning
before she went to the
hospital to see patients
and she would cook food
for the whole week.
[Kamala Harris] Oh yeah, mommy did that too.
[Mindy Kaling] And so some food that was cooked,
dinner food was cooked at 6:00 a.m.
And then she would leave
and then all of our food was cooked.
And we, of course, didn't understand,
we're like, we wanna go to McDonald's,
but there is a four course Indian meal
for us even if she wasn't
there to eat it with us.
And it was that kind of a thing
that was completely normal
when you're the children
of professional immigrants.
[Kamala Harris] Listen, this is how it was,
because we would often
come home from school
before our mother would
come home from work.
And there was always fresh baked cookies.
[Mindy Kaling] No.
[Kamala Harris] Always, always, always.
[Mindy Kaling] Oh my God.
[Kamala Harris] So all of that stuff,
everything was from scratch.
And this is why maybe I've become,
hopefully, not a snob about food--
[Mindy Kaling] Someone who could cut
up onions like that,
like we're on a cooking show.
[Kamala Harris] But I take it
very seriously.
[Mindy Kaling] Yeah.
Listen, this is controversial,
I put peas and cashews in mine.
Yay or nay?
[Kamala Harris] I noticed that.
That,
you know, I mean--
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, all right.
[Kamala Harris] It's fine.
You could do it--
[Mindy Kaling] Your silence
was very damning.
[Kamala Harris] Yeah, (laughs).
[Mindy Kaling] I knew what you wanted to do.
[Kamala Harris] No, but you know what, I wanna try it.
Go on, go for it.
[Mindy Kaling] No, because I don't wanna
suffer the consequences
of our future president
not liking my Indian food.
So why don't I just,
we'll just play it safe?
[Kamala Harris] Okay, put a couple in.
Just put a couple in.
Can I just tell you something?
[Mindy Kaling] Yeah.
[Kamala Harris] I've never made dosas.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, but you're really
good about critiquing them.
Great.
(laughing)
This is gonna be great for me.
All right, so let's get
to the cooking part of it.
