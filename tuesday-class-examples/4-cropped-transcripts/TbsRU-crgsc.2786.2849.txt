Roosevelt said that the president's the
presidency above all else is a place for
moral leadership and I believe there are
lines that we do not cross their
morality lines edged in dignity about
people's inherent Worth and we should
never across those lines and they have
been crossed so many times around
immigration around women around building
walls and that at the very least we can
we can argue about policy we can argue
about whether you know Social Security
lock boxes or what should we do around
taxation health care those are important
things but at the very least a person in
that office should be a moral leader and
that line should never be crossed
because when you cross it it says so
much more about your integrity than it
does about the people you're attacking
