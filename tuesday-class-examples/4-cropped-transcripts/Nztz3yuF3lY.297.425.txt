over 30 years ago.
When I was seven and a half,
I was diagnosed with diabetes,
and I started to give myself
injections of insulin every day.
And, as was common back then--
gratefully, less common today--
you were-- I was embarrassed
-by my condition.
-Right.
I thought it showed weakness.
I thought my friends
would make fun of it.
And so I hid it.
And as I grew older
and I took multiple shots
a day--
'Cause, at first, it was only
one, and I did that at home.
Over time, it grew to two shots
and still at home,
morning and afternoon.
But as I grew older,
multiple shots a day
were more common
and more frequently
before I ate anything.
I was in a restaurant in
New York in my thir-- early 30s,
and I would order my meal
and then go to the bathroom
to give myself my shot.
This day,
I didn't go into the stall.
I stayed in the public areas
because it was
a two-stall bathroom,
-and there was no one there.
-Mm-hmm.
As I was finishing,
a woman walked in.
She saw me doing what
I was doing and finishing up,
putting my injection away.
And I walked out.
I ate dinner, finished,
walked by the woman
and I overheard her say
to her companion,
"She's a drug addict."
And I stopped.
And the first emotion I felt
was shame.
I was mortified.
And then...
I thought about it for a second.
And I turned around and marched
back to the woman and said,
"I'm not a drug addict.
"I'm a diabetic.
"And that shot you saw me take
"is the medicine that saves
my life every day, insulin.
"And if you don't understand
"when someone's doing something
different than you expect,
"just ask.
Don't presume
the worst in people."
-And I walked away.
-Wow.
-And...
-(applause)
