That's the sport of business.
Business is a sport and a competitiveness,
just like basketball, football, baseball,
or anything and it's the competitiveness
when I was 21 years old,
I won my first Cadillac
sellin' Shaklee Vitamins.
I told myself I wanted to
own my first jet at 35.
- Did you pull it off?
- 100%, 100%, and then
when I was in my 20's
I said when that Forbes 400 came out,
I said I wanna be on that list one day.
So you gotta set yourself
goals and try to set
yourself apart, and I talk about that
in the book is that anybody
can set themselves apart.
You can be the best sound guy.
You can be the best cameraman.
You can do certain things
and study your field
and then you get a break
because you were such
a good cameraman or
you're the best sound guy
that you got recommended to go on this set
and then this set, and
then all of a sudden
in Hollywood, you're known
as the best sound guy.
You can do things to separate yourself
from everybody else by just
working a little harder.
