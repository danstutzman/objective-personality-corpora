Or, you know, sleep is for sissies.
What do you say to those people who are like,
you know, I wanna hack everything and get
as most done as possible.
How do you combat that?
Well, I think the most important thing is
to give people the data and the new scientific
findings about sleep, and that’s why I’ve
structured the book this way.
You know, to start with a crisis so that you
give people a clear awareness of the dangers
of sleep deprivation.
Then move on to the science, you know.
What gives me optimism is that the new science
of sleep, and it’s relatively a young science
because the first big scientific sleep center
was not founded until 1970 at Stanford.
But it’s so conclusive about how sleep is
a performance enhancer, how it affects every
aspect of our health from diabetes to cancer
to heart disease to Alzheimer’s.
And then the history of sleep, you know, we
need to understand how did we come to devalue
it?
Going back to the first Industrial Revolution
when we began to think that we can treat human
beings like machines and just minimize downtime.
And one of my favorite chapters is the chapter
on dreams, about the mystery of sleep, and
how it can become a gateway to a more spiritual
dimension of ourselves.
All that is the first half of the book.
And before we get to the hacks and the best
practices and tips and techniques, I really
want to urge people to read the first half
because if we don't change our minds about
the importance of sleep, it’s going to be
much harder to change our habits.
Yes.
We need to convince ourselves of sleep’s
importance.
I kind of convinced myself the hard way by
collapsing from sleep deprivation, but I’m
hoping that people can convince themselves
without having to go through a painful wakeup
call as I did.
And frankly, Marie, I’m really grateful
that I did.
It could have been so much worse.
