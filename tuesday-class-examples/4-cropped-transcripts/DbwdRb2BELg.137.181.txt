like yeah I guess I'll sell what else am
I gonna work on boom at the end of the
story I think the number one thing that
got me to where I am today is just
simple hard work okay
I've always worked my buns off well
beyond anybody I know in my peer group
okay but if you work twice as hard to
something you generally gonna get twice
as far for not three times father
so overwork is definitely the number one
thing and then if I could pick a second
one as to what got me to where I am I
would say over preparation I over
prepare for everything I do
born out of insecurity of maybe not
being able to deliver and what an
advantage that is in any situation when
you walk in and you've well over
prepared over the next competitor you'll
usually leave the situation with the
gold I had so many jobs none of them
