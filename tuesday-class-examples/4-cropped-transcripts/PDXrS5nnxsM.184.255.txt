almost every week I would take a book
and explore it.
- How did you learn to study? 
- I asked. That's actually the most important
ingredient for success. When you don't
know something,
ask someone who does how to it.
She asked one of the smartest students
in her fifth-grade class and she told me
what she did
that she read whatever our assignment was and then she took
a pen or pencil and underlined the
important parts of it
- Have you always been curious? 
- Yes. You have to be interested in what you
don't know.
I think that the most interesting
people are those that are curious about the world around them.
- You say there's one most important question, what is it?
- Why. Every time I have a legal question, I ask what's my purpose,
why am I doing this.
Once I have identified the purpose, I then ask myself
so how do I do it? and once
I've asked how do I do it, the third
question is
is there a better way to do it?
