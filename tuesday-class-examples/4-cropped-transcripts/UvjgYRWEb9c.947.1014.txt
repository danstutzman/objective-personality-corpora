when it comes to just pure mindset,
you talk about in the book,
something I think that's
surprising that needs
to be talked about more.
You basically say don't
be afraid, but worry more.
Because everything in the modern world
is guys just like, don't worry,
everything just works out,
but you're, there's quite
a few business people,
great business people,
you're, you know, Forbes list,
that say it's the paranoid who survive.
How do you balance that
with having happiness
but also worrying about things?
- I have no fear because
I do my due diligence.
Okay, so if I do a deal,
I deserve to get kicked
if it doesn't work because
I did my due diligence.
I don't do make believe performance,
I always do a worse case performance
for myself and I know
there's a paddle for your ass
if you don't watch out.
- Yeah, I like that saying,
paddle for your ass.
- Okay, so every day I get up,
I have no fear of doing any deal,
but I also worry about
everything and I worry about
where can that paddle get
me and so I better know
my stuff every day.
