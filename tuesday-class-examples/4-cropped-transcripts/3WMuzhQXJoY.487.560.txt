without jumping at the opportunity
to insist that women are the real victims.
Well, after years of researching
and fact-checking,
what the men's rights activists
were telling me,
there is no denying that there are
many human rights issues
that disproportionately
or uniquely affect men.
Paternity fraud uniquely affects men.
The United States Selective Service
in the case of a draft
still uniquely affects men.
Workplace deaths: disproportionately men.
War deaths: overwhelmingly men.
Suicide: overwhelmingly men.
Sentencing disparity, life expectancy,
child custody, child support,
false rape allegations,
criminal court bias,
misandry, failure launched,
boys falling behind in education,
homelessness, veterans issues,
infant male genital mutilation,
lack of parental choice
once a child is conceived,
lack of resources for male victims
of domestic violence,
so many issues that are heartbreaking,
if you are the victim
or you love someone who is the victim
unto any one of these issues.
