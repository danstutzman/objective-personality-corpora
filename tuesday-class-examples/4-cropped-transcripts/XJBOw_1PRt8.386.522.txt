Right And what's happening in
this one besides scariness?
Well, I mean it's
a remake, so it's
very close to the
original story.
I play a single
mom who, you know,
is just doing the best she can.
And she gets her son a
gift, which just ends up
being a murder doll.
Which sucks.
And I would say the only--
like the big difference
between the original is like
there's the update is really
with Chucky.
Chucky is no longer a
possessed demon doll.
It's now a smart doll.
So he's connected to the cloud
and he can control devices.
And there's kind of a more like
you know technology can be evil
kind of--
Oh, that sounds more real.
--which is something that
I thought was really cool.
Because I don't really
want to be in a movie
where people are stabbing
me and, you know,
I don't want that in my life.
My brain, you know.
No, not at all.
But I can get behind a
movie where it's like, oh
technology is the villain.
Yeah, and it is.
It can be.
If it's not used for good.
Exactly.
So the kid on--
I understand-- did
you play pranks on him
or did he play pranks on you?
What happened?
We-- he played pranks on me.
He was constantly
playing pranks on me.
He was hiding in my
trailer screaming at me,
freaking me out.
He even when the
camera was rolling,
he was praying
playing pranks on me.
We would be doing scenes
which would have nothing to do
with pranks, and he would--
I'd be like walking
across him, you
know, to the window or something
and he'd stick his leg out
and trip me.
On camera.
And I'd be like, Gabriel do
not mess with me on camera.
I am your mother on camera.
And I tried to get him back
but I did not really succeed.
Oh, well we wanted him to be
here and scare you today but
and it's too obvious
Oh, that'd be his dream.
We were going to scare you.
We were actually ready
to go and everything.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I was really going to scare you.
Oh my god.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Look, look, look, look.
OK.
There's nothing in there.
Don't.
No, I'm showing you
Chucky's in there.
Chucky.
Don't.
Chucky.
I know Chucky's here.
But I seriously was, and then
they said that's too obvious.
And so but--
All right.
All right.
Hi, I'm Andy.
