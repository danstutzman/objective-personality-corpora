and it prompts you to move.
When you start to use it and then you read
about it you’ll see that it’s being used
all over the place; they use it in the armed
services in order to align troops and get
them to start an exercise, they use it in
elementary schools; five, four, three, two,
one at big assemblies to get a huge room full
of kids to stop talking.
Tom: Exactly, a really simple and interesting
example yeah.
Mel: Because it requires you to focus it’s
not a habit.
It will become a habit that prompts you to
have confidence and courage, but in the beginning
it interrupts patterns of behavior that you
do on autopilot, it helps you assert control
and it teaches you how to become the kind
of person that moves from thinking about something
to actually doing it.
