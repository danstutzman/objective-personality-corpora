We kept on working.
Tom Bilyeu: You seem to have a really strong
internal set of values.
When did that begin to take shape in terms
of policies that you could implement in the
company?
Was it right away?
Did that take time?
John Paul D.: When I worked for other companies,
some of them, not to mention any names, were
so bad.
They would treat people the old way, "I'm
the boss.
Here's what you're going to do because I'm
the boss."
There were times, for example, when maybe
you had a dollar for lunch.
You can't get a lot for a dollar.
I just knew that that’s how I was, and if
I had a company that I had control of, by
gosh, everyone's going to be treated the way
I wanted to be treated.
The minute we could afford it, everyone had
free lunch.
Whether you had money or not, you have free
lunch.
We pay for it for you.
Carpool, we'll pay for that.
We started doing things for people that I
wish happened to me.
Maybe that’s part of fate.
Maybe because a lot of things along the way
weren't so good, that as things started getting
good, it was so easy for me to share with
our people, so easy to do that.
People sometimes don’t save money.
As soon as we possibly could afford it, we
started profit-sharing where at the end of
every year, we'll take that profit-sharing
and put it in a retirement fund for you.
It's yours.
It's yours.
If you're here so many years, it goes with
you no matter where you go.
It's yours.
That’s your money.
Tom Bilyeu: It's really incredible.
How much do you think that that sort of golden
rule approach has fed into your ridiculously
low turnover rate, which is literally almost
unprecedented?
That’s crazy.
John Paul D.: I try and treat people exactly
the way they'd want to be treated, exactly
the way I would have wanted to be treated.
I'm happy with my people.
I realize my people are the company.
If my people go, my God, the company goes.
People are your company, and they take care
of the customer.
The customer is always right no matter what,
so what do we do so the customer is happier?
If somebody's unhappy, we try and discover
why, and because you treat people this way
... We love them.
You walk in our company, it's love.
If you go to the front desk here in Century
City, this girl just has the biggest blessing,
"Hi, welcome to John Paul Mitchell Systems."
She loves what she does.
Our big problem is we don’t have turnover.
We have so many people who want to work for
us, and the thing is you got to wait for somebody
to die.
