FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE AND THAT IS,
AS A NATION, WE HAVE GOT TO
FINALLY DECIDE WHETHER
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT OR
IT IS NOT, WHETHER EVERY MAN,
WOMAN AND CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY
IS ENTITLED TO HEALTHCARE
BECAUSE THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS,
OR WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO HAVE A SYSTEM RUN BY
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE
DRUG COMPANIES WHERE THE MAJOR
GOAL IS TO MAKE HUGE PROFITS FOR
THOSE ENTITIES.
AND I THINK THE TIME IS NOW FOR
THE UNITED STATES TO JOIN EVERY
OTHER MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH --
I'M TALKING ABOUT CANADA, U.K.,
FRANCE, GERMANY -- EVERY MAJOR
COUNTRY THAT GUARANTEES
HEALTHCARE TO ALL PEOPLE, AND
WHAT A MEDICARE FOR ALL SYSTEM
IS ABOUT IS SAYING WE'VE GOT A
GOOD PROGRAM NOW FOR SENIORS,
IT'S CALLED MEDICARE, LET'S MAKE
THAT PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO EVERY
MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN THIS
COUNTRY.
