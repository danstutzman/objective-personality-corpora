Thank you.
- Okay, well, first of all
you know what they tell you on
airplanes put your
own oxygen mask first.
- Yes.
- That is key.
They don't say that
because they are nice.
They say that because you won't
be much use to anybody else if
you're not breathing.
So you're not going to be
much use to your children,
your patients anybody if you
let yourself burn out.
