- This is Monique, man,
I'm telling you, oh--
- Babe, he be sayin'
it like I'm a problem.
(audience laughter)
- Oh, you have been a problem.
- Well, Steve, okay--
- What was it?
Let's go.
- Let's go.
- You started getting
labeled as difficult.
- Yes.
- Why do you believe that that happened
and do you see that changing and why?
- I got labeled as
difficult, my husband and I,
and my husband is Sydney,
who happens to be my manager.
We got labeled as difficult
because I said one word,
and that was no.
Now I said no to some
very powerful people.
I said no to Oprah Winfrey.
I said no to Tyler Perry.
I said no to Lee Daniels.
And I said no to Lionsgate.
And the difficulty came in
when people that look like me,
like Oprah, Tyler, Lee
Daniels, and I gotta
put my brother Steve on the list.
Y'all knew I was not wrong.
Each one of you said to me,
"Monique, you're not wrong."
And when I heard you go
on the air and you said,
"My sister done burnt too many bridges,
"and there's nothing
I can do for her now."
Steve, do you know how hurt I was?
- You see, Mo, now let me give you this.
Because, you and I had this conversation,
I thought you went about it wrong.
See, I felt that you had
done yourself a disservice
by the way you chose to go about it.
- Tell me how I went about it.
- I was cool with your deal with Netflix.
I was cool with you.
The two problems that we had, number one,
the boycott of Netflix,
- [Monique] Yes.
- we never gave people a point of action.`
okay, if we're gonna
boycott, are we gonna not
get subscriptions, are
we gonna turn it off,
are we gonna go down there and get signs.
The second point what
was comin' to me was,
this problem you had with Netflix,
is rich people problems.
Cause they lookin' at us
goin', you talkin' bout
you didn't get millions,
but you got this, you oughta be cool.
- But when you say, Mo, what's
the way you went about it.
And I wanna explain that, and
I thank you for saying that.
Inequality is devastating
and it's extreme.
And when people said,
Monique, do you think
calling a boycott was extreme?
You damn right.
But isn't inequality extreme?
So we've gotta get to a place
where we're unafraid to say it out loud.
What I would have loved, what I would have
appreciated from my
brother, was had you picked
up the phone before you
went on the air and said
Monique, you've burnt too many bridges
and there's nothing I can do.
Say, I would've appreciated had my brother
called me up and said, Baby let's talk.
Because you doing that was a
part of me being difficult.
- But now, before that though--
- Yes baby.
- Remember the moment on stage?
- Oh yes.
- See, now that there--
- That was a wonderful moment Steve.
- No it wasn't, Monique.
- Oh my goodness.
- No it wasn't!
- That was one of those moments
I love that Richard Pryor--
- See, no it wasn't
- Whispered in my ear and
said, say it, you say it.
- Richard Pryor did not tell
you to say those things--
- I'm gonna tell you
something, yes he did,
oh baby, yes he did, yes he did!
(audience applause)
I do not regret, as I said
on the Steve Harvey show,
I do not regret one moment
of that night on that stage--
- Now Mo, now in case you
don't know, Mo told Tyler Perry
- I wanna hold your hand.
- Oprah Winfrey--
- Uh-huh-
- And Lee Daniels--
- Tell 'em.
- To suck her private parts.
- Not my private parts.
- Well you said if I had one.
- Yeah.
- I want them three to
suck my private parts.
- Yeah!
- It wasn't private
parts on stage, so now,
then I went houhhh, I quit breathin'.
I quit breathin' for you!
