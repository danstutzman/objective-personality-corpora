dinner or or something but I don't binge
drink at all anymore I don't know what
else they do I've just lived
I just live a lot more simply no I think
and like I spend just a lot more time
with myself I used to fill everything
with seeing people and doing things and
like you know trying to be there for you
know do things for other people but I
think really now I look at my life and
it's like five miles an hour
and it just looks like peaceful yeah and
like very calm and I think that was like
the biggest change for me is like having
a free evening and you know not booking
your sched want to do everything yeah
just cooking dinner and
being you know not ordering delivery on
your way home 11:30 at night and then
eating in bed and hurting the sleep and
then waking up at 6:00 and like you know
that's what it was like it was
around-the-clock mayhem and no I just
you know feel very calm it's great what
