&gt;&gt; SO THIS PLACE HAS KIND OF
BECOME YOUR HOME FOR STANDUP IN
NEW YORK CITY?
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE DONE THE RESIDENCY
BEFORE.
COMING BACK TO DO IT AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
&gt;&gt; WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK HERE
AGAIN AND AGAIN?
&gt;&gt; IT'S THAT BASEBALL GLOVE THAT
JUST -- YOU CAN'T BEAT IT, YOU
KNOW?
YOU HAVE -- YOU HAVE A FEW
GLOVES IN YOUR LIFE BUT THERE'S
THAT ONE THAT'S JUST THE PERFECT
FIT AND THE SOUND WHEN THE BALL
HITS THE GLOVE AND THAT'S YOUR
GLOVE.
THIS HOUSE IS MY BASEBALL GLOVE.
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO PREPARE
FOR A RESIDENCY DIFFERENT THAN
ONE-OFF STANDUP GIGS?
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU DO
DIFFERENTLY?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
DIFFERENT EXCEPT THAT I JUST
FEEL DIFFERENT AND, YOU KNOW, I
KNOW WHO I'M TALKING TO.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; I'M TALKING TO NEW YORKERS.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN I TALK TO HOW
ANNOYING IS IT TO BE CONSTANTLY
RECOMMENDED RESTAURANTS BY
PEOPLE AND HOW THEY PUSH YOU,
YOU HAVE TO GO.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; TO THIS RESTAURANT.
IT'S LIKE, OKAY, YOU KNOW FOR
THE STREET CLEANER, WHAT IS THAT
GUY DOING?
ARE THEY CLEANING?
ARE THEY REALLY CLEANING THE
STREET?
&gt;&gt; JUST KIND OF MOVING THE TRASH
AROUND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL.
&gt;&gt; SPINNING IT.
&gt;&gt; WITH THE TRAIL OF WATER OUT
THE BACK.
ARE THEY JUST LAUGHING IN THERE?
WATCH OUT!
WE'RE CLEANING UP.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE DRIVING OR YOU'RE
WALKING DOWN BROADWAY, YOU SEE
THE STREET SWEEPER.
YOU HAVE THAT INSTINCT THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT
THAT STREET SWEEPER.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YOU SAY THAT'S STUPID?
WHAT DO YOU DO, WRITE IT DOWN?
&gt;&gt; I LIKE TO PLAY WITH IT ON A
PAD.
&gt;&gt; THE YELLOW PAD.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
I LOVE MY YELLOW PAD AND I FIND
THAT TO BE -- THAT'S MY --
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE MY STEAM
ROOM, YOU KNOW?
I JUST LIKE TO JUST THINK OF
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; MOST COMEDIANS DO NOT DO THAT
IN MY EXPERIENCE OF TALKING TO
THEM.
THEY LIKE TO WORK IT OUT ON
STAGE.
I LIKE TO HAVE BOTH.
I LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE
ARCHITECTURE AND THEN I LIKE TO
PLAY WITH IT ON STAGE AND THEN
HERE'S THE OTHER BIG SECRET OF
COMEDY, THE AUDIENCE WRITES MOST
OF IT.
YOU KIND OF GIVE THEM WHAT YOU
THINK IS FUNNY AND THEY GRADE
