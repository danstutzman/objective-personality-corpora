But you know your 5%,
maybe I'm not quite focused
cause I'm trying to go
in too many directions,
so it's just you workin' with yourself
and sayin' I have got to
follow through on this
or I'm not gonna get it
done and I can't lose,
'cause all of us guys that are successful,
we have ADD, okay, that
is why we're successful.
- Do you think you have ADD?
- Do I think it?
I know it, now when I
was in school I think
my teachers thought I had
other bigger problems,
'cause we didn't focus on it then.
But I realized I have it because I think
all my kids have it.
It's just somethin' that you'd be shocked
at how many of us have.
- I think I heard your
daughter laugh out there
when I said do you have ADD?
- And but most successful
people do for some reason
because that's our brains
that they're working
in a complicated way and that we're trying
to always go do something else.
So I have to stop myself
and say I can't go on
to this next deal or this next project
till I follow through and make sure
that I've done everything
here to make sure
I'm successful.
So it's kind of pinching myself and saying
"Step back and catch
yourself, or you're gonna
have a bad deal here."
- It's that discipline.
