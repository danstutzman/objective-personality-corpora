CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BOOK.
I'M SURE IT IS A LOT OF WORK AND
THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT I'M SURE 
IT'S VERY SATISFYING.
>> I'M ENJOYING MYSELF.
IT'S BEEN MANY, MANY YEARS SINCE
I HAD -- SIX YEARS SINCE MY LAST
BOOK.
>> Jimmy: TALK ABOUT THE TITLE 
OF THE BOOK, "TALKING TO 
STRANGERS" AND -- 
>> THE BOOK IS ALL ABOUT THIS 
IDEA THAT WE THINK -- ALL THE 
TOOLS WE HAVE FOR MAKING SENSE 
OF OUR FRIENDS BETRAY US WHEN WE
TALK TO STRANGERS.
SO WE'RE REALLY GOOD -- IF I 
KNOW YOU REALLY WELL, I HAVE A 
WHOLE SERIES OF STRATEGIES I USE
TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND YOU, 
DECODE YOUR BEHAVIOR.
>> Jimmy: UNCONSCIOUSLY.
>> UNCONSCIOUSLY AND 
CONSCIOUSLY.
>> Jimmy: OKAY.
>> BUT THEN IF I TRANSFER THOSE 
SAME STRATEGIES TO SOMEONE WHO'S
A STRANGER YOU GO OFF IN ALL 
KINDS OF WEIRD AND RANDOM 
DIRECTIONS AND YOU END UP MAKING
ALL KINDS OF GRAVE MISTAKES.
AND THE BOOK IS ABOUT -- IT'S A 
WHOLE SERIES OF STORIES ABOUT 
ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR 
STRATEGIES FOR DEALING WITH 
STRANGERS -- 
>> Jimmy: I THINK THAT'S TRUE.
AND I HAVE MY OWN KIND OF 
EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE LED ME TO 
THAT.
LIKE I'VE HAD -- YOU KNOW, YOU 
WALK OUT AND I'LL SEE THE 
AUDIENCE AND MOST EVERYONE IS 
CLAPPING AND HAPPY AND THEN YOU 
MEET A GUY-U SEE A GUY WHO'S GOT
HIS ARMS FOLDED AND I INEVITABLY
WILL ZERO IN ON THAT PERSON.
START TALKING TO THAT PERSON.
AND THEN THE GUY SAYS OH, I'M 
JUST REAL EXCITED TO BE HERE, 
YOU KNOW, I WATCH THE SHOW EVERY
NIGHT.
AND YOU GO, OH, I THOUGHT YOU 
WERE UNFRIENDLY AND IT TURNS OUT
I WAS JUST WRONG.
>> THE WORD -- THE TECHNICAL 
WORD FOR THAT, THAT PERSON IS 
MISMATCHED.
SO MATCHED IS WHERE -- ATHENTHO 
ANDERSON WHAT MOO WAS JUST HERE 
PERFECTLY MATCHED.
WHEN HE WAS TELLING A STORY YOU 
GOT THE SENSE AS YOU LOOKED AT 
HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION AND BODY 
LANGUAGE, IT WAS PERFECTLY IN 
HARMONY WITH THE WAY HE FELT 
INSIDE.
BUT THERE WASN'T THAT KIND OF 
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO 
THINGS.
THE GUY IN THE AUDIENCE LIKE 
THIS WHO'S HAVING A GREAT TIME 
IS MISMATCHED.
