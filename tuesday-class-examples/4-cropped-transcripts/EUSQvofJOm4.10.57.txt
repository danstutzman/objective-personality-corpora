- Yes.
- As we try to come through this
'cause what I want really
is for you to come through
'cause I know who you really are
and so, what I want you
to do is come through this
with a different way because you Mo'nique,
you my girl!
I love you like a sister.
I hate what's happening to you.
I hate what they're
saying that's not true!
I want them to know that you are caring,
that you're a great mother,
that you are incredible talent.
I don't like the fact that
you've been black balled.
You can be un-blackballed.
You too talented to have
to worry about all this
where the next one coming from.
I want this to end for you.
- Well listen--
- I want it to end for you, Mo'nique,
because I love you.
(cheering)
Because these people are
doing it the wrong way
and you better than that.
You are better than that.
