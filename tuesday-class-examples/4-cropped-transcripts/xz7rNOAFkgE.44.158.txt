[Mindy Kaling] Hi guys, it's Mindy,
I'm here in my kitchen
and today, we are cooking but we have
a very special guest, very special.
Senator Kamala Harris.
[Kamala Harris] Hi guys.
[Mindy Kaling] Wait, so here's what I wanna know.
[Kamala Harris] Okay.
[Mindy Kaling] Is it respectful to call,
I should be calling you Senator Harris,
right?
[Kamala Harris] No, you should not,
that's not on my birth certificate.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, Kamala?
[Kamala Harris] Call me, yes, please.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, because the Indian in me,
I feel like my parents,
my dad, will watch this.
[Kamala Harris] Just don't call me auntie.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay.
(laughing)
I won't call you auntie.
They'll be like, how could you
call her by her first name?
She's worked so hard.
Okay, so what we're gonna cook today.
[Kamala Harris] Okay.
[Mindy Kaling] Is an Indian recipe.
[Kamala Harris] Yes.
[Mindy Kaling] Because you are Indian.
[Kamala Harris] Yes, yes, yes.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay and I don't know
that everybody knows that.
But I find that wherever I
go and I see Indian people
at the supermarket, on the street,
everyone's like, "you know
Kamala Harris is Indian, right?"
It's like our thing we're so excited about
to have you running for president.
[Kamala Harris] Yeah.
[Mindy Kaling] So we're both Indian.
[Kamala Harris] Yes.
[Mindy Kaling] But actually,
we're both South Indian.
[Kamala Harris] Yes, you look like the
entire one half of my family.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, thank you.
[Kamala Harris] You do.
You do.
[Mindy Kaling] I've been telling people
we're related already so this is perfect.
It's basically true.
(laughing)
And so we're you raised
eating South Indian food?
[Kamala Harris] South Indian food,
lots of rice and yogurt,
potato curry, dal, lots of dal, idli.
[Mindy Kaling] Yes, idli.
That's a deep cut.
Okay, so what we're cooking
today is two things.
One of the South Indian staples is dosa,
which is kind of like a sourdough crepe.
And then we're gonna make a potato curry
which is the traditional accompaniment.
So I printed out, so--
[Kamala Harris] Where did you
get this recipe?
[Mindy Kaling] We're doing it
the old fashioned way, which is,
I printed out a recipe from the internet.
[Kamala Harris] Okay, I'm ready.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, so when I told my dad
that I was gonna be cooking
South Indian food for you--
[Mindy Kaling] Yes.
[Mindy Kaling] He was extremely excited.
He said I shall get some spices.
But he took them all,
all the Indian spices
and he put them in--
[Kamala Harris] In the Taster's Choice jars.
And this is exactly
what my mother would do.
So when I walked in and saw this,
literally, I didn't know
it was actually a thing
among our people.
[Mindy Kaling] I guess it's
an Indian thing.
[Kamala Harris] It apparently is a thing.
[Mindy Kaling] Okay, cool, so this is all
of the spices we're gonna use,
courtesy of my dad.
[Kamala Harris] Okay.
[Mindy Kaling] And then, dosas take a really long time
