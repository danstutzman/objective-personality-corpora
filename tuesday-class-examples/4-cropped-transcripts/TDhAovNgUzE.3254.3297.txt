as cliche as that sounds yeah I think
that's really the deal that's cool
and you put the actors through boot
camps yourself or some type of training
oh yeah what's it like it's it's tough
and as long as it it is compressed well
it differs ok it depends on how much
time the producers are ready right and
it's isolated and there's no phones no
agents no nothing you live a hole in the
ground and you eat what I give you if
you don't piss me off that day and then
if you do you don't eat Wow and it's
very very rugged physically I'm gonna
grind you down to the lowest common
denominator so that I can then begin
teaching so all it's on your mind is how
you survive that white haired demon so
BMN I've got you I can teach you I can
