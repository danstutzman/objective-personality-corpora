because it gets me ready.
As the owner of The Post,
I know that at times The
Post is gonna write stories,
they're gonna make very
powerful people very unhappy.
- Are you upset if they are
writing critical stories
about Amazon, which they do?
- No, I'm not upset at all.
- Did you call and interfere?
- Never, I would be
humiliated to interfere.
I would be so embarrassed.
I would turn bright red
and it's nothing to do with,
I don't even get so far,
I just don't want to.
For me, it would feel icky,
it would feel gross.
It would be one of those
things when I'm 80 years old
I would be so unhappy with myself
if I interfered.
Why would I?
I want that paper to be independent.
