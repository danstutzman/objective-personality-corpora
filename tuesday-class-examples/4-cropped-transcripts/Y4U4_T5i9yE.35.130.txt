>> Dr. Amen: So today we’re going to teach
you about the connection between post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain
injury (TBI).
I’m so excited to tell you that our research
department just got a landmark paper accepted
for publication in brain imaging and behavior.
Really wonderful scientific journal where
we can distinguish between people who’ve
had emotional trauma versus whose brains have
been physically traumatized nearly 94% of
the time.
>> Tana: So, I thought this was so interesting.
So when we first met, you scanned me after
two weeks.
A lot of people have heard the story now.
He said before he got really serious with
anybody and we got along really well.
He said he wanted to see my brain naked before
he saw any other part of me naked.
So a little tidbit there but when he scanned
me, he said, ‘Wow.
You have this diamond shape pattern in your
brain which means there’s been some trauma,
some emotional trauma.’
And I’m like, ‘No.
I’ve had no emotional trauma because I like
have this very tough façade.’
He’s like, really?
And he does this little psychiatrist thing
and I’m like, don’t shrink me.
But as he started talking to me about my history,
my childhood, I was amazed.
It was very fascinating to me that that connection,
he could see that pattern in my brain from
unresolved childhood issues which now he never
lets me live down.
>> Dr. Amen: I’m not like that.
Trust me.
