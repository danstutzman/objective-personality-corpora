even before the government agencies do.
- But in a way, the general sentiment
towards the big innovative
tech companies has changed.
Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon,
they used to be seen as
the nice guys in tee shirts
that are saving the world
and now they are sometimes portrayed
as the kind of evil of the world.
And the debate about the
big four or the big five,
The Economist is suggesting a split up,
other powerful people like Josh Soros
are giving speeches in Davos,
the EU Commission is taking
pretty a tough positions here.
Do you think that there
is a change in mindset
in the society?
And what should the big tech companies,
what should Amazon learn
from that or do with that?
- I do sense,
I think again, I think
it's a natural instinct.
I think we humans, especially
in the Western world
and especially inside democracies
are wired to be skeptical
and mindful of large
institutions of any kind.
We're skeptical of our government
always in the United States,
state governments, local governments,
I assume it's similar in Germany,
it's healthy
because they're big powerful institutions,
the police, the military, whatever it is,
it doesn't mean that you don't trust them
or that they're bad or
evil or anything like that,
they're just, they have a
lot of power and control
and so you want to inspect them,
maybe that's a better word,
you kind of always want
to be inspecting them.
And I think if you look
at the big tech companies
they have gotten large enough
that they're going to be inspected.
And by the way, it's not personal.
I think where some of the,
you can go astray on this
if you're the founder of a company,
one of these big tech companies
or any other big institution,
if you go astray on this
you might start to take it personally,
like why are you inspecting me?
And I think that,
I wish that people would just say,
"Yes, it's fine."
