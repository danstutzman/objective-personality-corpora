about this before-- because if
that can happen, what's next?
What are they are going
to take away next from us?
I think we used to-- we always
have to look to black women.
Black women always vote
in their best interests.
94% of black women voted
for Hillary Clinton.
Well, 53% of white women
voted for that guy.
We have to look-- black women
vote in their best interests,
always historically.
They always know what's up.
And we have to be
sisters to them.
We have to vote in their
best interest as well.
Yep.

So this is bringing me to the
question about your Netflix
special, which is--
is it a documentary?
A documentary on
white privilege,
because I was looking around
a lot after the election
happened, and I was just
kind of looking at myself,
and I started to read
a lot of black authors
that I hadn't read
before, because I
was stuck in my own world.
And I just started to think
about all the privilege
I benefited from in this
industry specifically.
Being a Jew is a bonus.
Being a girl as a comedian when
I was coming up was a bonus.
There weren't a ton of us.
I had every advantage and
every door opened for me.
And when I started
to look around
people that don't have
as successful of a career
or are working twice as hard
to achieve the same things,
I started to feel really
gross about myself.
So on a very fundamental level
I wanted to examine it further,
and Netflix is great because
they're just, like, yeah go.
I'm like let's start with
my own white privilege.
I mean, I've just been
badly behaved for 20 years
and getting tons of money thrown
at me for being a loud mouth.
I mean you could
say I'm talented,
but you could also
say I'm not talented.
It's really neither
here nor there.
So for me it's an important
subject matter right now.
It's like what are the
people that are benefiting
from this going to do about it?
And I'm somebody who's
benefiting from it.
Good for you for doing
something about it.
Thank you.
Thank you, I'm glad I'm
doing something about it.
It's eye opening.
I mean I get in trouble
every single day I shoot.
I say the wrong thing.
I'm dying to know how
to be a better person.
So I think we can
all learn from it,
and I think white
people obviously
have a lot-- a long way to go.
Yes, we do.
