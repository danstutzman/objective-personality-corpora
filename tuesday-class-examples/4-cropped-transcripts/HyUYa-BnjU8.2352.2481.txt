Ok, once again.
Yes.
We’re all grownups here.
Yes.
I do believe that it is humanly possible for
the human mind to hold two completely opposing
ideas as true at the same time.
I agree.
And this is why, for instance, I’m capable
of being a completely rational, scientific,
empirical person who believes in evolution
and global warming and reads The Science Times
and thinks it’s all fascinating and at the
same time I can keep a place in my mind awake
and alive to mystery, magic, and miracle.
No problem.
Yes.
Like, I do not see this as a contradiction.
I have…
I have a big mind, you have a big mind, we
can do both of those things at the same time.
You know?
And… and so the paradox that you have to
be able to hold onto comfortably if you’re
gonna do any kind of creativity is exactly
that.
As you’re approaching it you have to approach
it as though nothing matters more than this.
And then sometimes minutes later you have
to be willing to throw it away and be like,
“Eh, it doesn't matter.”
You know?
So, like, when I’m writing, that’s what
I’m moving back and forth between all the
time is I’m sitting down and I’m like,
“This sentence has to be the most beautifully
written sentence in the entire world and it
is spiritually and artistically lazy of me
to bring anything less than that.”
And I’m, like, laboring over this sentence
and I’m trying to bring… and I love it
and then I go back later and read the paragraph
and realize that it actually doesn't work.
And then I’m like, “Ah, screw it.”
So, like, you love it and then you dismiss
it.
Yes.
You love it and then you dismiss it.
It is not… the thing is, your work has…
one of the big problems that I’ve seen,
I talk about this in Big Magic too, is when
people refer to their work as their baby.
It ain’t your baby.
It ain’t your baby, it’s not a human baby.
It’s not a human baby.
There’s a lot of differences between this
book and a human baby.
Like, for instance, this.
Watch.
Like, oh my God.
You’d arrest me if I did that to a human
baby.
But I can totally do that.
I can do that.
I can rip pages out of it, it’s just a thing.
It’s just a thing I made.
It’s not a baby.
And it’s independent of me now.
Yes.
Because it’s finished, so it doesn't need
me.
Yes.
And people can attack it and they can criticize
it, they can misunderstand it, they can steal
parts of it, they can do all sorts of stuff
that you wouldn't do to a human baby.
And it will be fine and I will be fine because
there’s a difference between me and this
