You are better than that.
I probably should've called
you as soon as, but I didn't.
I got a lot of stuff going on.
So I didn't.
- I understand.
- When I did call you, I listened to you.
But I began telling you
at the very beginning,
I think we goin' about this the wrong way.
Now we keep saying stuff in the interim
that keeps just making it worse.
Hollywood know you talented.
- But it's making it worse for who?
- It's making it worse!
- For who?
- If you think it's cool, then it's cool.
- That's what I'm sayin'
to you, baby.
- But it's not cool, Mo!
- For who?
- It's not cool!
- [Mo'nique] For who?
- The fact that we sittin'
here arguing like this--
- We're not arguing.
- OK, we're discussing.
- You and your sister,
we havin' a conversation
and Mommy and Daddy ain't here right now
and I'm gettin' ready to
punch you in your mouth.
That's the conversation, bam bam.
Right, I think what happens though is,
I've had to understand
how to agree to disagree
without being upset
and that's the thing.
I disagree with my brother.
I'm not upset with you, I love you.
I disagree with the way
Oprah, Lee, and Tyler did it.
But I love them!
- Cool.
I give you that.
Now guess what we need to do
to move forward and fix this?
- What we need to do?
- [Mo'nique] Come on.
- These people owe you an apology.
You owe those people an apology.
(clapping)
Then we can move forward.
Mo, listen to me.
You are valuable to us all.
You are valuable to Tyler Perry.
You are valuable to Oprah, to Lee Daniels.
We can't do this without talent.
See, me and you, we talent.
They can't do this without us.
You take us outta Hollywood,
they'd have to close
some doors round here.
It is not the same without us.
- Yes.
- You are too valuable.
I don't want to lose
your gift to the world.
- You won't.
- Because we tryin' to prove a point
when we can prove the point by doing it
in a more loving way.
