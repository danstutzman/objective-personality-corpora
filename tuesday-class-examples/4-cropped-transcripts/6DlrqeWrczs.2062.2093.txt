Did you hear me?
Did you see me?
And did what I said mean anything to you?
That's what everything's about.
So the reason why I left my boss's office,
when I was asking
for a raise, I, I knew he didn't hear nor
see me neither.
And that I was not going to get the
validation that I needed.
Now I couldn't articulate that at the
time, but
I just knew let met get out of here.
But now, I know, I can feel it inside of
myself.
I'm not going to get the validation that
I'm looking for.
