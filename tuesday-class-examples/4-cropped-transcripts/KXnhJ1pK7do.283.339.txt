accessories you can you know
accessorize with your makeup like you
can wear a completely plain outfit and
then be like BAM glam in your face and
you like this is my accessory you know I
mean before school starts
if you're out your nighttime ER team
figure out how long it takes to get
ready in the morning
ok here's an idea for your when you wake
up in the morning set your alarm but
have like three alarms so i usually wake
up at six thirty
but if i'm going to go glam a wake up at
six ten and if i want to go like an
everyday look
then I'll wake up 6 30 if I want to do a
natural no makeup make
look which I have a tutorial on that
i'll wake up at like 645
so just know your arm know how long it
takes for you to get ready and no like
