This is gonna hurt.
This is gonna hurt.
This is gonna hurt.
Ok, so I think there are two kinds of creators
in the world: there are the martyrs and the
tricksters.
And most of us were schooled in martyrdom.
You know, we come out of a pretty heavy Christian
Germanic, romantic tradition that says by
your suffering you shall be redeemed, really.
And… and your scars are the badges of honor
that show how seriously you take your life.
And how much you destroy yourself and everyone
around you in the process of making something
shows us how seriously you take your work.
I reject it.
I reject it.
The other way is the trickster way.
And so the martyr walks around saying, “I
will do this even if it kills me,” and the
trickster says, “I didn't come here to suffer.”
You know?
And the martyr says, “By my wounds I shall
be known,” and the trickster says, “Pick
a card, any card.”
The trickster is playing with this whole thing
the entire time.
You know, the martyr says, “I’m gonna
end up in a broken heap and… and that’s
how you’ll know that I was serious.”
And the trickster says, “I’m gonna walk
off with your girl while you're doing that.”
The martyr is like Sir Thomas Moore and the
trickster is Bugs Bunny who’s always looking
at how to sort of subvert and do things differently
and do things more playfully and do things
in a transgressive way.
You know?
And that, I feel like, is where the instinct
for art originally came from.
Because art does that, it turns things upside
down, it looks at things sideways, it plays
with things, it… it de-sanctifies the holy
thing.
Yes.
See, the martyrdom is all about this kind
of sanctity that is so heavy that it will
break you.
And the tricksterdom is like what if we don't
have to treat this thing like it’s a holy,
sacred relic?
What if I turn… what if I, like, put sparkles
on it?
What if I…?
You know?
I get out my bedazzler.
What if I just get my glue gun and… and
just… you know?
Like, what if nothing’s holy and everything’s
allowed?
That’s what art has been asking for centuries,
even holy, even sacred art has been asking.
You know, even the Sistine Chapel has a bunch
of little, like, winks from Michelangelo like,
“What if the Pope is not infallible?
What if I, like, give him donkey ears?
What if I…?”
Yes.
You know, there’s always, like, this sort
of playfulness that art wants to do.
And all we wanna do is take it so seriously
that we kill it and often ourselves in the
process.
And so if you can learn how to dance with
the trickster part of yourself, which is in
you because we all have martyr in us and we
all have trickster in us.
And… and trust.
That’s the thing about the trickster, the
trickster trusts the universe.
Trusts that if the trickster takes the ball,
throws it into the universe, the trickster
knows it’s coming back.
It might come back 3 years from now, it might
come back in a hailstorm of, like, 20 balls,
it might come back, like, in some really comic,
strange way, but if you engage there’ll
be a response.
And the only thing the trickster wants to
spend its life doing is playing with that
sense of, like, put it out there, see what
happens.
Put it out there, see what happens.
And it’s just a more fun way to live that
isn’t quite so heavy and isn’t quite so
macho.
And… and that’s the way that I’ve always
wanted to engage with my work.
And whenever I catch myself being the martyr
I’m like, “Are you falling for this?
Are you falling for this thing that says the
only way that you can be creative is to suffer?
Because you know better, right?”
And then we trick our way out of it.
