what what am I gonna solve by going at
an egg avatar on Twitter sometimes I do
that but I don't engage either angel at
what point will be going at bald rape 97
how is that gonna be stupid white guy
hugging his girlfriend I mean I like to
sit on the sidelines and watch the
insanity unfold
Facebook's great for that too like
people you went to high school with just
slowly just going into absolute sheer
insanity I like to sit on the sidelines
I have Spike Lee tickets to just people
going nuts on the Internet
but but to think that I can I can at one
point have you argued with someone
online in their go they're like you're
right Charlemagne I'm sorry
season record is Owen 82 right so why do
you continue to get other people riled
