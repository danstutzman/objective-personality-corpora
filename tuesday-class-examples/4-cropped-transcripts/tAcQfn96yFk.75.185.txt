But, I'd like more training, 
so suddenly, I found myself in this field.
I'd never worked 
in a medical field in any way,
and I found a real calling to it.
My basic job description
was personal care.
I was looking after meals and showering,
wiping people's backsides,
helping them with their medications.
All the things that just become too hard
when you are terminally ill.
So the people I was caring for,
with those who knew they were ill,
and were in their last three
to 12 weeks of their life,
and they knew they were dying, 
so they'd gone home to die,
and I was there in their home.
What I found over time though 
was that my role,
the physical duties I did
were just a by-product 
of what I was really there for.
And my key role was as a listener, 
and I didn't realize at the time
that so many of my own prayers 
were being answered.
because I had 
some of the greatest teachers.
These were regular, humble people,
but they were just like all of us.
The difference was that they were 
at the end of their lives.
They were looking back over their lives.
A lot of them had regrets, not everyone,
but a lot more did than didn't.
And those common things
just kept coming at me again and again,
and had a profound effect 
on me personally.
I listened to their regrets,
and I witnessed 
their anguish, their heartache,
and I learned from them.
I realized that I was being blessed 
with these lessons for my own life.
If I didn't try to incorporate them,
I too would regret that.
