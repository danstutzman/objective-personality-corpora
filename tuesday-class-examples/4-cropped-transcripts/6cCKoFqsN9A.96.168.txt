Why was your dad terrifying?
He was racist
He would say incredibly awful, unrepeatable things about women
When I was like really inappropriately young, he would tell me how to deal with women
I cannot repeat what he said. Not even ...
It's so awful
It's misogyny on steroids. It's the King Kong of misogyny
