"You're dumb and bad."
Now, the reason I bring all this up
is to say that I'm 28
and I really pride myself
on being self-aware, and
I really pride myself
on aiming to live my best life,
but if you had asked me, over the course
of the last six months, "Are you somebody
"that's really insecure
and takes other people's
opinions and judgments to heart?"
I'd be like, "No, not at all.
"That's not the idea
of me at all, actually.
"So, no. I mean, why are
you even asking me that?"
So, the reason why I call
this an identity crisis
is I realized, wow, I am so sensitive.
I really am like a sponge.
I pull in other people's feelings
and other people's negativity
and I will just absorb it
and just totally ignore
and neglect myself.
