and they're never satisfied.
And you need to harness,
in my view, you need
to harness that energy
primarily on your customers
instead of on your competitors.
And so I sometimes see companies
and even young small start
up companies, entrepreneurs,
go awry
is they start to pay
attention to their competition
than they do to their customers.
And I think that in big mature industries
that might be a winning
approach in some cases,
kind of close following,
let other people be the pioneers
and go down the blind allies,
there are so many things
that a new, inventive
company tries won't work
and so those mistakes
and errors and failures
do cost real money.
And so maybe in a mature industry
where growth rates are slow
and change is very slow.
But as you see in the world more and more,
there aren't very many mature industries,
change is happening everywhere.
You see it in the automobile industry
with self driving cars
but you could go right down the line
of every industry and you would see it.
