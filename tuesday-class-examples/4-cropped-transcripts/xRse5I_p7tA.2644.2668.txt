favorite example of this is actually a
surgeon himself Atul Gawande and he
hired a coach a previous surgeon who was
retiring to review the video of his
surgeries at a time where you could
improve and what he could do better and
I think that's a brilliant example of
how to have a coach even if you're not
in sports or not you know not a
competitor or something we can all
benefit from the feedback and the
tighter the feedback cycle the faster
you learn that's powerful I love a man
this is powerful stuff I'm gonna ask you
