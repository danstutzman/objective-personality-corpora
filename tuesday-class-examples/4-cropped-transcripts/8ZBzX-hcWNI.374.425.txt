And as far as my teachers told me,
nothing really. So I was very angry.
And finally, with punk rock,
my anger had focus and a backbeat.
Joe Strummer informed me
why I was angry.
The Ramones taught me
it's okay to be a loser and
not get invited to the party 'cause
you can hang out with the Ramones - 
and I'll take that company any day.
(crowd chuckling)
So it's with punk rock that I said,
"Oh! I have- I got people.
I got a tribe.
And my life has a soundtrack."
And I realized I was an angry
young man - for a myriad of reasons.
And I started to focus it
into writing and into work.
Like, "I'll give you 40 hours a week
at this minimum-wage place."
"Give me 60, and in 6 weeks,
I'm gonna run this place! Watch me!"
And the last boss I ever had
was my boss at HÃ¤agen-Dazs,
my ice cream shop, and, to this day,
he still comes to my shows.
And whenever I see Steve,
who got me my 1st apartment -
I was living in my car -
and believed in me,
whenever I see him, I get all weepy.
