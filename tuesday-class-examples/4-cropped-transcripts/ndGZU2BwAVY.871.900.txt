think with what you just said it sounds
like you think that if you're gonna make
it you're gonna make it no matter what
and if there's no like oh well things
didn't go your way the first year and it
ruined the you know the trajectory of
your career it's either you have it or
you don't
sounds like excuses to me I mean you got
to figure it out right if you really
have an obsession to figure it out you
will figure it out right and every
puzzle is constructed differently a a
situation when he came into the league
was different than mine Mike situation
in Chicago was different than mine right
everybody has a different puzzle man you
just got to figure out your own puzzle
