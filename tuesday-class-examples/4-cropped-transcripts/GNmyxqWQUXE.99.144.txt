Patience is a weapon.
I mean once you understand a patients in
silence can be a weapon you can use it to
great effect. I'm impressed what Nancy
Pelosi is doing. I'm impressed with what
Chuck Schumer's doing. I mean the people on
the side of this on the Senate side on the
House side they've just decided they're
going to have to buckle up and they're gonna
have to bear down and they're going to have
to survive this. President Trump has a
history of the people that are quiet with
him have the best long term relationships
even though he's very combative. People
don't do well with him being combative in
return and those that that remain patient
remain calm end up working their way through
the situations and that's what the leaders
of the Senate and the House are doing these
days. They're staying calm and are here to represent.
