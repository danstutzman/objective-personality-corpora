but still focus on my strength?
- Well, you've become
successful because you do
95% of everything right.
And everybody that is successful,
every business out there,
they're doing 95% right,
but the ones that really make it
go figure out the details on the 5%.
And I always know that
I have to keep pushing
and driving everybody to get that 5%.
And let's just look at it in a simple way.
You know, I can drive up to,
and I'm just gonna use a
restaurant or a retail store
just as an example.
I was talking to Walmart,
their Saturday morning meeting
a couple of Saturdays ago.
And I just, and somebody
asked me about the 95/5 rule
and I said, let me just
give you an example, okay.
You're the general manager of a Walmart
and you drive up to
your store that morning
and you's look in the
parking lot and you see
is there bottles left out
there or cigarette butts
and you go up to the front door
and you look, are all the lights on,
is the sign right?
Is there dead weeds around the flower beds
around the front door,
all the baskets in there,
you know, you go to the front door,
and is there smudges on the glass
and you, does it look real clean out there
or is there spilt drinks and everything.
Well, I hadn't even walked in the store
and me personally or that general manager,
I can judge the general
manager of that store.
I can tell you if that's a well run store.
And I can pull up any of my restaurants
or anybody's retail store and tell you
before I ever walked in the door if that's
a good operator or not.
And if they're not a good
operator on the outside,
why in the hell should
I think they're gonna
be a good operator on the inside?
So just think about when
you're drivin' around
and you're lookin' at somebody's business.
And it'll tell you a lot about them.
That's the 5% from just
a visual standpoint.
