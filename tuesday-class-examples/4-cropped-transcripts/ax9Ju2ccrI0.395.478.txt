YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS
FRIENDSHIP IF YOU LIKE THAT.
BUT YOU AND I ARE MYSTICALLY
MINDED.
>> Stephen: SURE.
>> AND I THINK EVERYBODY CAN
RELATE, WHETHER YOU'RE RELIGIOUS
OR SPIRITUAL OR NOT.
IT'S SORT OF A FOOL'S GAME, THIS
THING WE'RE STUCK IN.
LIKE I WAS RECENTLY EATING ICE
CREAM ON THE BEACH, AND I WAS
LIKE, "AH!"
I WAS HAVING THIS NICE MOMENT,
I'M EATING ICE CREAM, I'M ON THE
BEACH.
BUT THIS IS FLEETING.
YOU EAT THE ICE CREAM, THEN IT'S
GONE.
THEN YOU WANT WATER.
THEN YOU HAVE TO USE THE
BATHROOM.
THEN YOU NEED DINNER.
THEN YOU'RE BORED.
THEN YOU WATCH TV.
AND THEN YOU'RE TIRED.
AND THEN GUTO SLEEP.
AND THEN YOU SHOWER, AND THEN
YOU EAT BREAKFAST.
IT'S ENDLESS, LIKE FEEDING THE
ANIMAL.
IT'S NEVER-ENDING, AND HAPPINESS
IS SO MOMENTARY AND FLEETING.
SO I WROTE THIS BOOK TO KIND OF
TELL-- IT'S LUKE A SPIRITUAL
MEMOIR ABOUT THE JOURNEY THAT I
LEARNED THAT TRUE JOY AND THE
ONLY PEACE THAT I HAVE
EXPERIENCED IS IN LEARNING TO
IDENTIFY WITH YOUR SOUL-- WHICH
IS WHAT CHRISTIANS WOULD CALL
IT-- OR YOUR SPIRIT.
SO I KNOW IT'S A WEIRD THING FOR
COMEDIANS TO DO.
>> Stephen: NOT AT ALL
>> I KNOW THAT'S UP YOUR ALLEY.
>> Stephen: COMEDY IS MY--
>> I KNOW.
>> Stephen: COMEDY IS MY--
COMEDY IS MY IOWASCA TEA.
>> YOU CAN FIND IT ANYWHERE PUP
CAN FIND IT THROUGH SCIENCE OR
TRADITION.
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
I'M NOT TRYING TO TURN PEOPLE
INTO ME.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SHARE WHAT'S
GIVEN ME JOY.
>> Stephen: THERE ALREADY IS
ANOTHER YOU AND HE HAS TO GO TO
THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW.
"COMEDY SEX GOD" IS IN STORES
TODAY.
