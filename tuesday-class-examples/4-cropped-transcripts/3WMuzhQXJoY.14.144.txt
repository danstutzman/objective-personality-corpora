In 2013, I decided to meet my enemies.
I was a 27-year-old, award-winning
documentary filmmaker
and a proud feminist.
And I was determined
to expose the dark underbelly
of the men's rights movement.
At that point, all I knew
of the men's rights movement
was from what I'd read online,
that it's a misogynistic hate group
actively working against women's equality.
Well, the vast majority
of my previous work
was about women's issues.
I directed documentaries
about reproductive rights,
single motherhood,
and the need for more girls
to get into STEM education.
So when I learned that no one had ever
documented the men's rights movement
in a film before,
I saw it as an opportunity
to continue fighting for women's equality
by exposing those preventing it.
So for one year, I traveled North America
meeting the leaders and followers
of the men's rights movement.
I spent anywhere
from two hours up to eight hours,
interviewing each individual
men's rights activist,
also known as MRA,
and I filmed 44 people total.
And there is an important rule
in documentary filmmaking.
As an interviewer, you do not interrupt.
So I'm asking questions,
and I'm getting their full life story.
And in the moment, I didn't realize it,
but now looking back I can see,
that while I was conducting my interviews,
I wasn't actually listening.
I was hearing them speak,
and I knew the cameras were recording,
but in those moments
of sitting across from my enemy,
I wasn't listening.
What was I doing?
I was anticipating.
I was waiting to hear a sentence,
or even just a couple
of words in succession
that proved what I wanted to believe:
that I had found the misogynist.
The ground zero of the war on women.
