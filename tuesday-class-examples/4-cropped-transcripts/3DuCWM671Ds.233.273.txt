the pop-culture space quite like Apple
product announcements what confuses you
what annoys you when non tech people
cover Apple
I mean Apple is probably the most
popular company out there so there's a
lot of people who just kind of
peripherally are aware of how massive
they are and with that you always get
people who ignore the tech and just
focus on the fact that people are big
Apple fans I call you an Apple fanboy
they'll say you're a mindless sheep if
you like Apple at all no matter what
your reasoning someone's gonna say that
I think some people are mindlessly just
getting the next iPhone just because
it's the next iPhone but as someone who
actually likes to put thought into and
analysis of products it's kind of weird
to get that from people what's the worst
