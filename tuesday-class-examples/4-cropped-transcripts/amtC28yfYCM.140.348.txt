-Then why were they invited
and not us?
-Well, we went to the --
We got to go to the Met Gala.
-That was fun.
-Dude, you looked gorgeous,
by the way.
Here's a picture of you
at the Met Gala.
Look at that.
-Thank you.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-Your crown.
-This is why I like this show.
You just put up
flattering photos of me.
-That's all I do all day long.
-It's very nice.
-Look at the crown.
Look at that.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Talking about the royal wedding.
I mean,
you got the crown right there.
Come on!
-It was a lot.
-I saw you for a second.
-Yeah, I saw you.
-But you looked very handsome,
but I felt like I saw you
and you were like, "Hey!"
and then you were gone
like a puff of smoke.
Like, you were in,
and you were --
Did you -- Did you take a --
-No, we were getting gonged.
We were getting --
You had to go to your seat.
-Oh, it's very formal.
-People were yelling at me.
People wanted me to go sit down,
so I saw you quickly,
and then we both
had to, like, part.
-[ Laughing ] We both parted...
-We both parted ways.
-...romantically, yes.
-Who were you sitting with?
-Okay, so, I sat
at a very glamorous table
at the Met Ball.
I sat next to Black Panther
himself, Chadwick Boseman.
-Oh, Chadwick Boseman's
the best.
-Yeah. So cool.
It was great.
But I also felt like
I tried to make --
I don't know Chadwick at all.
He looked extremely handsome,
as Black Panther does.
-Sure.
-And he was sitting next to me.
And I felt like
I kept kind of trying
to make it seem
like we were together
'cause he didn't have a date.
So he was here, I was
just like [Laughs haughtily]
Like, we had all these private
jokes and things like that.
-Was he in on the jokes?
-No. No, he hated it.
[ Laughter ]
He thought it was weird,
but I was, like, "Okay.
Whatever. I'm wearing a crown.
Like, it's fine."
-Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Exactly.
-I felt
like someone could look at us
and think, like, "Okay,
he plays a king,
she looks que--
they're the king and queen
of some really bitchin'
third-world country."
You know?
-Did you see Rihanna there?
-Oh, I saw. Yes.
-Yeah. Well, you were
in the movie with her.
-I was in a movie with her.
-"Ocean's 8." This is it.
-"Ocean's 8."
Every pro has its cons.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-Every pro has its cons.
-Every con has its pros.
-Coming out June 8th.
-Coming out June 8th.
But the thing with Rihanna
is that
she's so famous that I feel
like whenever I see her,
I have to be like,
"Oh, hi, Rihanna.
I'm Mindy.
I was in a movie with you."
Because --
-You reintroduce yourself?
-I reintroduce myself to her.
-You re to Ri?
You re to RiRi.
-[ Chuckling ] I re to RiRi.
And I think she seemed
relieved that I did it.
-Oh, really?
-Because she was like,
"Thank you.
Thank you so much."
-"That's where I know you from."
-And she was very nice.
-Uh, yeah.
Did you get that much time,
filming the movie together,
to hang out with her?
-We did -- We had a -- Yeah,
we had several scenes together.
-Who do you play in the movie,
in "Ocean's 8"?
-I play a jeweler who knows
a lot about jewels.
-Uh-huh. 'Cause it's about
a jewelry heist.
-Yes.
-Someone is trying to steal
a $150 million piece
of jewelry at the Met Gala.
-At the Met Gala, no less.
-Yeah.
-It's you and everybody.
What a great cast.
But then you are
a jewelry expert.
-Yeah, it's a lot of me
with, like, an earpiece
being like, "The jewels
are ready."
[ Laughter ]
I never --
-How many times did you do this
and say, "The jewels are ready"?
-So many times that,
at a certain point --
You dream when
you're a sitcom actress
that you have an earpiece
and you're like,
"The jewels are ready"...
[ Laughter ]
...that you just have
someone to talk to.
Sometimes in scenes
when I wasn't in,
I was like, "Got it, Chief."
-You were just putting
your finger in your ear?
-You don't have
anything in your ear.
-No, you have nothing
in your ear.
-You're just doing it.
-But it must have been so fun
with everybody
and Sandy and -- Sandy Bullock.
-Sandy Bullock.
-The whole cast is --
Right?
What more can you say?
-She's from "The Proposal."
-She is from --
You could say that.
She's from "The Proposal."
-She's from "Speed."
She's got that "Speed."
-I know who Sandra Bullock is.
Yeah.
She's got that "Speed" money.
-She's got that "Speed" money.
-[ Laughs ]
She's got that "Proposal" money.
-I know. Yeah.
Oh, and...
-"Miss Congeniality!"
-"Miss Congeniality!"
That's exactly right!
All right. Good. Yeah.
That -- Jinx.
