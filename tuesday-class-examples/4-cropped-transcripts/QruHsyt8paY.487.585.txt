So at age thirty-three (laughs)
Now, to say that I cried a lot, that was very indicative of just being a, a kid who  also got pushed around by everybody
Eventually, I did the thing where I hardened my shell and
Dad and Mom said I stopped crying and I stopped crying after I was like twelve and I just, didn’t cry after that
Off camera: Tell me more about that age
Eugene: As a young kid I always thought I was bad, I just thought I was bad, naturally
Because of what the church I was in was telling me, because of the society I was in, as a Southern person, or as a Korean
When you grow up thinking that you’re bad for some reason, I think that really shifts the way that you look at the world
I was never in a position where I had enough support
Or education, or confidence  in any area, that when someone ridiculed me for either being Asian
When people thought I could be gay
I was never at the point where I thought they were wrong
I had a strong belief that I was not only bad, but I was wrong, there was something wrong with me
A lot of my journey was kinda figuring out that I was never inherently a bad person
You can put this in the video Kane-
I-
Am afraid that some people I’m very close to will disown me
And not talk to me anymore
Because of this video
Knowing that someone might be homophobic, and a couple of people could be
And that’s hard
Kane: Do you think that’s it for everything?
Eugene: We’re gonna find out
There is also just a reason why
Gay is such a toxic word to some people, and I think that
Other words, like queer and LGBT mean nothing to some people
I think it’s because there’s still people I care about, and there’s still systems I am a part of, that prescribe to that way of thinking
It’s hard to express those complexities when you’re so public
