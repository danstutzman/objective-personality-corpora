4,000 children miners are working in Kolwezi, a city in Congo that is steeped in cobalt these children often have no option
But to work because there are no schools or parents to support them and even when they do have parents their wages are so low
That the children have to work in order to survive so child labor is definitely a very complicated issue but in my opinion
It doesn't really have to be as long as companies start prioritizing
People over profit, then things like this wouldn't happen
But we also need to be more conscious as consumers and put pressure on these companies
To have higher ethical standards. If any of this was happening in Europe were in North America
We wouldn't be forming lines outside of Apple stores to get their latest shit
We'd be throwing rocks, but because these child workers and dead miners are far away
We could care less as long as we can get our hands on shiny new gadgets every year, and that is not okay
And I do believe that us as consumers have to hold companies accountable
for their actions I think
We are a lot more conscious and empathetic compared to corporations that only see value in profit and not in human life
So I do believe that the most powerful way to bring change is if we as consumers become more aware
Companies like Apple Samsung and LG like to remove themselves from the situation as much as possible and claim
They can't know where or under what conditions their cobalt is coming from or that
It's not even their responsibility
But I argue that it is because they are the ones making the most profit out of this blood technology
by them cutting down on their profits
they can't increase wages down the production chain they just don't want to but since they operate under a
capitalist model of needing to constantly grow and make more
Profit that means that they push to get the lowest possible price from their battery manufacturers
And then they do the same for their cathode manufacturers
And then for the cobalt processing and finally the cobalt miners at the bottom of this pyramid get the shorter end of the stick
earning inhumane wages and appalling working conditions
also
Everyone up that line of production
Can earn more and more all the way to the top of the pyramid where people like Apple's CEO Tim Cook
Can enjoy an eight point seven million dollar salary or Samsung chief executive Kwon oh-hyun
Can earn six thousand six hundred and ninety eight billion in total compensation, and I'm not sure what that even means?
but that sounds like a lot of money and
Reducing profit is not the only solution another thing that tech companies can do is make their products easily
recyclable to help in the reuse of cobalt that would otherwise end up in a landfill or tech companies can create products that last longer and we
don't have to replace them every single year because they're
Outdated and what they can do is make parts easy to replace and update instead of forcing us to buy an entirely new product
But of course that only benefits us as consumers and customers
Financially, and it's also more environmentally friendly
But it definitely doesn't
