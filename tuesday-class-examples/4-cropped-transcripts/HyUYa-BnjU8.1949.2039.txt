And I was like, “It’s not my problem if
my work isn’t good.
You know?
It’s not my problem.
It’s not even my fault.
Like, it’s not my problem.”
My problem… the contract that I made, the
only way I finished my first novel, because
it wasn’t good because I’d never written
a novel before.
So why would it be good?
Who, like, wakes up and knows how to write
a novel?
So I was 50 pages into this thing and I’m
25 years old and it’s not good and it’s
not… and I know what a good novel is, and
it’s not.
This isn’t working.
And, you know, every dignified part of me
wants to just put it in the bottom of the
drawer and walk away.
And then I just had, like, this, like, warrior
moment and I just remember exactly where I
was standing and I stood up and I said out,
“I never promised the universe I would be
a good writer.
I just promised the universe I would be a
writer.
That is the only thing I committed to.
This is not my problem.”
And I just sort of said to, like, the faeries
and the geniuses, I was like, “If you guys
want it to be good you’re gonna have to
chip something in here because this is what…
this is what I can do.
If you want to add something, feel… any
time, you know, feel free.”
And the other commitment I made was I do not
wanna go to my grave with 50 pages of an unfinished
novel in a drawer.
There’s enough of that in the world.
You know?
And the other thing was this voice where I
was anticipating the criticism because I knew
what the criticism would be because I knew
where it wasn’t good.
And I just said out loud to all my future
critics at that moment, I don't know what
kind of language I can use on your show.
Every kind of language.
We’re from Jersey, girl.
I said, “If you don't like it, go write
your own fucking book.
And you know what?
You won’t.
Guess what?
You won’t.
You won’t.
