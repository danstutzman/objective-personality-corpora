Well, you’re very kind and I will tell you
this, when Oprah Winfrey invites you to speak
at a stadium tour, you prepare.
Yes.
And I worked on that speech for 6 months and
what you heard me saying…
Yes.
...was memorized.
Well, but…
That was me just reading a poem that was memorized
in my whole… at 45, 50 minutes was just
a memorized piece of paper.
But I want you to hear this from an audience
member, like, you were so connected and that's
why I wanted to ask you about this because
your presence and your delivery and, again,
as someone… we just watch, I observe so
many things of like, she was so in it.
And I…
I could feel in my cells and in my bones,
I was like, “That took a tremendous amount
of work.”
It’s a huge amount of work.
A huge amount of work.
I was walking.
The only way I can learn a speech is to walk
it into my bones, so I was walking, like,
5 miles a day on the side of the road giving
that speech for 4 months.
You know, like, that’s how much I put into
it.
And the other thing is, I had this really
incredible moment the day before the first
one of those, because it was an 8 city tour.
Yes.
And it’s scary, it’s Oprah Winfrey.
She’s sitting in the front row.
Like, I invited you, I trusted you with my
audience, who trusts me with their lives.
Go ahead.
What do you got?
And you’re like…
20 thousand people.
Yeah.
I’m not used to speaking to.
I mean, who is?
Like, a place where, like, Bon Jovi plays.
You know?
Yeah.
So… so for me there’s this great thing,
there’s this great sense of this doubt of
am I worthy, do I belong here.
And I was backstage about 15 minutes before
I went on physically shaking.
And… and then I had this thought where I
thought, “You know what, Liz?
They don't need your fear, because they have
their own.
Like, that is the one thing they don't need.
Because they have… everyone who’s in that
audience has all the fear they’re ever gonna
need.
So you’re not gonna… if you bring them
your fear, you’re bringing them, like, it’s
coals to Newcastle.”
Yes.
“Ice to eskimos.
That they have.
They don't need your insecurity.
Again, they’ve got it covered.
They don't need your sense of low self worth,
they don't need your questioning of whether
you belong.
Believe me, they know those feelings.
Here’s what… here’s what you got hired
to do today.
Is to model to them dignity and composure
and grace and female autonomy.
So they need you to come out and stand in
your female body on that stage in front of
25 thousand people with an unshaking voice
and speak about courage, because that’s
what they came here for.
And if you bring them anything less than that,
you’re doing a tremendous disservice.”
And there are times in our lives where we
do serve by showing our vulnerability and
our fear.
Not that day.
Not that day.
Like, that’s it.
And I was like, “Oprah Winfrey is the person
in the world you admire the most, she thinks
you can do this, she’s not an idiot.
Do it.”
You know?
And bring them what they don't have.
Don't bring them what they already have.
Well, can I tell you, you did it.
