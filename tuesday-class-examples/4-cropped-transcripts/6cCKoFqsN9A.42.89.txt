You once said in an interview that your life is paranoia and fear and you're just trying to not get hit
Yeah
Is that still true?
Yeah, anger and fear: fear of failure drives me
Paranoia of things going wrong around me, drives me
I'm driven by a lot of kind, really ugly anger
So I have a lot of that in me
And it comes from a father who was terrifying and teachers who yelled at me and told me I'd never be anything
And so, I descend from the sky and land on things really hard
And I go at everything with that amount of fury
I'm not saying I'm going to hit anybody and I'm not mad at you
I'm very happy to be here and I'll answer every question to the best of my ability
But I go at everything like 'you think I can't?'
'Hey you wanna try acting?' 'Yeah, I'll try acting.'
'Can you act?' 'No. So let's go.'
