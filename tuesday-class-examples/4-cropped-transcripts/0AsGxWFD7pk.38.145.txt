Parts of it sound like repression,
and other parts sound like creation.
At what point do we separate the two?
Have you ever heard me say that emotions are bad?
No.
Have you?
No, emotions are the end product of an experience.
So then, do I react in my life?
Yep, I do.
But the question is,
how long are you going to react?
That's the real question.
Because if you keep that emotional reaction going on for an extended period of time,
sooner or later it will become your identity.
And then people say, "Why are you so bitter? Why are you so frustrated? Why are you suffering so much?"
Your brain, in that emotion, you're in the emotion, which means you're in the chemical residue of the past
is going to call up the event because you're emotionally connected to it.
And you're going to say, "I'm this way because of that past experience."
So then imagine what I do with people.
We have people that have been abused.
We have people that've been traumatized, that've been assaulted.
We have people that've had very, very difficult pasts.
Have you ever heard me say to revisit the event?
Have you ever heard me say that?
Never do we need to revisit the event because once you do, you open the box.
But what we want to do is overcome the emotion because that's just what's lasting from the event.
You sit a person down, and the moment you sit them down, what do you think the body is going to do?
It's going to look for something to recreate that emotion because that's the person's identity.
Are you with me still?
