And even though I know somewhat of it, it
does.
It feels like facing this huge uncertainty.
It’s like one of the most terrifying things
I’ve ever experienced in my life.
Yeah, because you’re now suddenly writing
a capital B book.
Yeah!
You know, and you’re capital W writing.
And the self consciousness kind of, you know,
the list of things that the inner sensor whispers
in the ear of anybody who’s setting out
to write is fairly endless.
And the thing is, also continues to morph.
Right?
It never -- I mean, if it didn't morph it
wouldn’t be an inner sensor.
If it just said the same thing every day,
“You’re stupid.
You’re stupid.
You’re stupid,” then you would get used
to it and you would recognize it and you would
think like shut up, inner sensor.
Instead one day it’s you’re stupid.
The next day it’s the world doesn't need
this.
The next day it’s what will my mother think?
The next day it’s somebody did this better.
The next day is, you know, what right do I
have?
And on and on and back, you know, through
the circle of this.
And I think one of the things that’s very
helpful, and I think one of the reasons why
writers and artists like to hang out with
each other from time to time is because it
helps to demystify that.
Because everybody goes through it, but because
also it’s a solitary process.
You don't write with a team.
You write alone in your room.
And so when you’re alone in the room, those
demons are what start to emerge, and you completely
lose sight of the fact that that is in fact
part of it.
It’s part of the process.
