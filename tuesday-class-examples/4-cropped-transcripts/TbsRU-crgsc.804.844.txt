that pressure I probably would have
never tried out for that drill team but
in my in my world growing up you only
did two things you were a cheerleader or
you were on the drill team and
preferably you married a running back or
a quarterback I mean that was the way it
went and so for me I probably would have
been like president of the French club
you know I would have been in debate or
those kind of things paper oh for sure
yeah yeah photographer the yearbook yeah
but those things did not have a lot of
value really not no errants didn't
instill that is something credible or
worthwhile no it's just I cool was the
number one value at home cool
lots of friends popular yeah and that
just wasn't my I wasn't that thing hmm
