Ollie's hugging me to get
through this, thank you.
Look, point is, I have
something to confess.
I'm a really insecure person
and I don't think I knew that.
I think I thought I was this very proud,
confident person, which
in a lot of ways I am,
to the world,
but when it comes to my meaningful,
interpersonal relationships,
I'm really insecure.
Now, over the scope of my life,
my work, my interactions
from the day to day,
my beliefs about the world,
my visions of right and wrong,
I can just defend those,
defend those, defend those,
but when it comes to between me
and somebody else at a dinner table,
I'm always nervous that
they're somehow unhappy.
