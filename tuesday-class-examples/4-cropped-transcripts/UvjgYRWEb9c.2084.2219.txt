and he hasn't played basketball
in what, 20 years, 25 years?
So it's just the
competitiveness, the fight,
the keep punching, don't give up.
And that's what I've always
done, and even today,
and honestly when I got the Rockets,
I really thought I had,
that's it, I've kind of
accomplished everything
I want to accomplish,
but already there's something
else you want to accomplish.
- You're too, I can tell.
- I do in steps to go to the next step,
but it's a sport.
That's what I do.
I mean, why would you
always want a bigger boat,
you want a bigger plane, you
want another sports team.
You just keep punchin'.
- What do you say to people, 'cause I,
nowadays, I get people following me
that are very kind of zen and you know,
the absence of desire
is the way to happiness.
But you seem happy.
Do you think that there's
different approaches
to happiness, like do you feel your path,
even though you're saying they call it
a hedonic treadmill, you're kind of like
I got the jet, now I want this, then.
Do you think there's
anything wrong with that
or does that make you have a great life?
- Not at all, absolutely,
there's nothing wrong with it,
but also I have no problem with the person
who, first off, I respect
everybody for the talent
that God gave 'em and everybody
has a different talent.
You guys do something I can't do.
I have the respect for the Hispanic guy
that can take the engine apart of a car
and put it back together and go in there
and I just sit there like
God, you are so smart.
The guy that could just
be painting this house
and he's able to cut that
perfect line up there
between the two colors,
I just look at that guy
and I say how in the
world are you so talented?
How did, how did you get that?
You were just born with it and that guy's
just as smart as me.
I was just given a
God-given gift of understand
finances and economics and business,
just knowin' how to go out and sell myself
to be able to borrow
the money and do things.
But I have just as much
respect for everybody else.
The poet, the author, the whatever.
God gave us a talent,
find out what He gave you
and use that.
And it's not about money.
In academia, teaching, a
great professor who loves
to get up and teach is a wonderful person
and you know what, I
know I have lots of toys,
but you give me a good color TV,
a good comfortable bed and a cool room,
I'm pretty happy.
