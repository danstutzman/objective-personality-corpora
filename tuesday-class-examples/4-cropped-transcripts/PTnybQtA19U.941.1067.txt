MOLLY DECKER: That's awesome.
In the book, you
talk about wanting
to be a doctor when
you were little.
That's the story
that your mom loves.
ANNA KENDRICK: That's when
I thought I was smart.
MOLLY DECKER: You were
going to be a doctor,
but you're an actor/singer.
You didn't have a backup plan.
But if you weren't doing this,
because you clearly love it,
what do you think
you'd be doing?
ANNA KENDRICK: I'm
hoping I'd have
one of those bullshit
racket jobs, where
I was a life coach or a
personal organizer or something,
one of those made up.
I mean, I'm sure there are
people who do it well and are
effective, but I'd just
be really bad at it
but convince people.
I'd have a nice aesthetic
on my Instagram,
so people would
be like, she seems
like she's onto something.
MOLLY DECKER: Are you
good at advice in general,
outside of the career advice?
ANNA KENDRICK: No.
Very bad.
MOLLY DECKER: So that's just
what you would like to do?
ANNA KENDRICK: Mm-hmm.
MOLLY DECKER: That's hilarious.
ANNA KENDRICK: Just ruin
people's lives willfully.
MOLLY DECKER: Oh my God.
OK, question over here.
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, by the way.
ANNA KENDRICK: Thanks.
Thank you for speaking
into the microphone,
even though it's clearly not on.
[LAUGHTER]
I like that about you.
You're a rule follower.
I like it.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
ANNA KENDRICK: OK.
AUDIENCE: Often,
I think at Google,
we get asked what our
five-year plan is,
and you're very successful.
ANNA KENDRICK: I know.
[LAUGHTER]
AUDIENCE: Where
do you [INAUDIBLE]
in the next five years?
What are your goals?
ANNA KENDRICK: Do you know?
I don't fucking know.
Do you guys know?
Do you have answers when
people ask you that?
Can I have a show of hands?
Do you have a teed up answer?
Nobody?
You're Google.
What the fuck is going on?
[LAUGHTER]
No, I think that's one of
those insane questions.
I feel like a sociopath
would have a great answer
for that question.
But I don't have a plan.
Honestly, sometimes
I feel like my plan
is to work as hard
as I can until I
have a nervous breakdown
and have to say
that I have lupus or something.
I don't know.
I'm excited all the time
and terrified all the time.
How do you feel?
AUDIENCE: I feel-- that's great.
ANNA KENDRICK: How do
you feel about my life?
AUDIENCE: I feel like you've
got it all figured out.
ANNA KENDRICK: OK, great.
I need a lot of validation.
I appreciate that.
