That has unlimited power for you.
You could connect to, to that.
You, you, you are your best.
My greatest, one of my greatest lessons
came from a
guy who wrote a book called Seed of the
Soul.
I was doing him on the show and I started
talking this
consciousness spiritual talk, you know,
two months after I started the, the show.
And my producers will all be like, oh God,
there she goes again.
But I knew that even though masses of
people were not tuning in for that.
That the whole purpose of that platform
was to try to lift people up.
And now, I have a network and I can
articulate what it is I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to bring little pieces of light
into people's lives.
Because what is my job?
My job is not to be an interviewer.
My job is not to be a talk show host or
just to own a network.
I am here to raise the level of
consciousness, to connect people to ideas
