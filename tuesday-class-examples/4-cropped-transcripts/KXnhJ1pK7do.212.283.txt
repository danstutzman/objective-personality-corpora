to public school I would definitely have
my outfits plant because yeah that's
just how I am
also if you go to public school
find a perfect pair of jeans find that
go to pair that you know
looks good on you and you like the fit
you like the color you like this style
you need to go and find yourself your
favorite pair of jeans because those
pair of jeans you can wear with
everything you just know you have your
go-to pair of pants and then you just go
ahead and choose a shirt and there you
have your look
also if you like that idea if you
I can't talk ok basically what i'm
trying to say is once you find that
perfect pair of jeans
so you have like a blue one you should
try to get in like a black and maybe you
like a darker wash blue or light wash
blue or something like that because if
you know those jeans are awesome on you
then you can have other options and also
a good thing to go with those jeans is
have a bunch of options like graphic
t-shirts or just plain t-shirts because
you can always dress this up with
accessories you can you know
