That's all I want, Moe.
- I absolutely agree with you 100%.
The only way I know how to do it is loving
because that's all that's in my heart.
Now, when I say it, you

- Yes, but see, if it's in your heart,
love sound like love.
- Yes, yes.
- See, that's what,
- Yes!
- so if it don't sound
like it when you say it,
that's 'cause it ain't.
