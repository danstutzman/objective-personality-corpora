yeah but all it doesn't always happen
there have to be nights I I'm a
performer who sometimes likes to blame
the audience there have to be nights
can't do it their hand not be wood
cannot do it I may know that someone
isn't better than others but it's never
the audience's fault well let's focus
Oh audience agrees with that focus on
the sometimes the audience is not only
good but they're physically attractive
and that's distracting that's
distracting when you look out everyone
out there could have a modeling career
or no personal trainer you go like it
not old focus on the words well this is
this is la this says people from their
high school lived here yep
