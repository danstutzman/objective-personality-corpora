When you look back on
your own life at 19--
Yeah
--and the girl that you were,
what would you say to her now?
Nothing she would have
listened to or respected
or obeyed.
So I could tell her
all kinds of things
but she's still going
to go off and do exactly
what she was going to go do.
- Yeah.
You know like when I
look back at her face,
I see someone who is
committed to the path
that she was on, and
had to be, because it
took me to where I am now.
But you know they say that
every novel is a memoir
and every memoir is a novel?
- Yes.
That if you really want to
know what somebody is like,
read the novels that they write.
That's my memoir.
[LAUGHS]
I knew that was you.
Of course.
I didn't have to do any
research to describe what it's
like to be a young fast girl.
Yes.
Because that's what I was
and there was no stopping me.
Yeah.
I wanted to experience
everything, Oprah.
And I did pay
consequences for it,
but I also kind of get
why I was like that.
