out.
And I told my wife, Val, I told her about
it.
I was telling her how embarrassed I was that
here I am with all this knowledge of these
principles, but I can be taken down with a
series of mean tweets.
And I remembered in our discussion to say,
thank you.
I was like, oh, right.
Suffering is like sandpaper, and it's buffing
me and it called bullshit on me.
And I was like, thank you.
And as soon-- so here's the thought.
This guy's being an asshole to me and I'm
clinging onto it like this.
Somebody doesn't like me.
I wrote a book, maybe people won't like my
book.
Maybe they'll think I'm stupid and unworthy.
And who the fuck are you to write a book about
God and comedy?
Suck a bag of shit, you fucking ass.
And I'm clinging to it like this, and you
can feel it.
This is obviously just a metaphor, but you
feel it internally.
As soon as you say, yes, thank you, it's still
there, but you're giving it space.
You're going, all right, what do you got for
me?
Because the night before, I'd gone to dinner
with two friends.
One of them I didn't really know.
It was a friend of a friend of a friend.
And I noticed at the dinner that this person
wasn't really paying me much attention.
It almost seemed like she was bothered that
I was there.
Then we went to a comedy club and I performed,
and after the show, suddenly, I'm the coolest
person in the world.
She had 50 questions for me.
She was so excited.
How do you do that?
How much of that was planned?
And I caught myself feeling special, but even
more dangerously, feeling worthy of love.
I was like, that's right.
And my ego's going, you love me now, don't
you?
Haha!
You didn't know you were having dinner with--
[SINGS HIGH NOTE] --this.
And I told Val about that, too.
I was like, what am I doing?
I know that that doesn't matter, that I should
be drawing my joy and my peace from a fundamental
quiet place that is not circumstantial, that
is not derived from someone liking my comedy.
But there I was, feeling special.
The next day, the tweets.
And Val goes, ah, don't you see?
As Maya Angelou said, you can't pick it up
and you can't put it down.
Don't take any of it.
And this is for everybody, not just comedians
and authors.
This is for people.
You need to find a quiet place inside where
just the fundamental fact that you are participating
in reality is enough value and dignity to
draw upon at any moment, and it's not because
you had a good set and now they're interested
in you.
And just on the other side of the coin, you're
not unworthy because somebody said you suck.
