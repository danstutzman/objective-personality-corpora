If you had to, this is
your last day on earth,
you're going to space with Elon Musk,
and you wanted to leave
your family and humanity
like two or three sentences,
what do you say to them?
Your greatest thing, the
greatest Tilmanisms in just
a couple of sentences.
- Always be happy with what you have,
because there's always
somebody who has less.
Always be happy.
- Thank you.
