in different place was the ego was it
exhausting because there's so much going
on that year well his was beautiful
it wasn't ego it was logical had nothing
to do with ego I fulfilled my obligation
my obligation was to Lee Daniels you
paid me 50 thousand dollars my
obligation was to do the film when the
film was done you asked me to do some
promotions in the United States of
America I'm done
nan y'all are asking me to go overseas
to promote this movie guys I wasn't paid
to do that
you've got to make that make sense so I
can't go promote a film and put more
money in your pocket
for your family and that's my image I
can't do that so it had nothing to do
with ego it just had to make sense but
