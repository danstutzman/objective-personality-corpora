the way every student that was shown
that video will be seeing you on tour so
not just gonna be belinda everybody that
saw you in that video is going to be see
two younger people I mean I feel like
that's our main responsibility as adults
is to be role models to the young people
to follow and you know for all the kids
who felt some kind of inspiration and
ability to do just a little bit more
than they thought they could because of
something that me or Barack or my
brother or you have done that's that's
what more could we ask for
