Hello. My name is Jules. Hello brains! This is my first day of Vidcon and it's really exciting so far
We've gotten to hear talk by Jack who started Patreon. Which is why - reason why I'm so nervous?
This is the reason why that I'm even able to do all of this because we get someone to support on Patreon and earlier
We got to see John and Hank Green and he answered questions that I tweeted at him what's your best life advice
Have a good time!
No
[laughter]
And it was-just-this is all like really exciting and overwhelming and we met with um I don't have names or anything in my brain now. I'm excited
I'm this way right now flustered because I just realized that I'm going to all these panels
And I'm hearing all these people talk and like going
Oh, and I'm going to do a panel soon, and I'm a little freaked out. I gotta I gotta be honest
I am going to go sit on a stage for an hour and pretend
I have something that is worth coming to this
panel instead of a different panel that they could have gone to instead, and I'm a little nervous. Um
Yeah, try not to freak out. This thing is just growing This, this channel is growing and and the ability to reach people is
improving and I just sat in and listened to a talk about how to
build a team, because we have so many people helping out with the channel that I want to make sure I'm a good leader to
them and this has just gotten so much bigger than me
and I don't know what to do with it. 
 and like-I just hope that we can help as many people as possible.
Vidcon the after hours. We're at a party. [Edward] Damn! It's good to see you brains
