It’s part of the process.
Yes.
Okay.
This is important.
I can hear my audience already circling back
to where we were before.
Because I know they’re like, “But wait!
What’s the answer?” even though we had
a quote.
In terms of writing about stories, again,
I'm asking this more for my audience because
I don't necessarily have that many things
to uncover in that realm.
With your mom, with your son, with your husband,
did you, and I know this is just your experience
and not necessarily what you’d prescribe,
but did you ask for permission?
To like, you know, let’s say you uncovered
a story and it's about your marriage.
And it involves your husband and you’re
like, wow.
Okay, I’ve given myself permission to get
this on the page.
But now we’re about to cross this chasm
between when I’m potentially going to my
publisher going, “We want to include this
in the book.”
Right.
It’s really been case by case.
Yeah.
In the case of my most recent book, Hourglass,
which is about my marriage, before I wrote
one word, I was actually away when I finally
realized.
And it was kind of with horror that I thought,
“This is actually the thing that I really
want to write about.
I want to write about what it is to walk alongside
another person over time.
And the way that I can do that is by writing
about my marriage.”
That’s -- as a memoirist, that’s -- I’ve
used my own life almost as a laboratory.
I called my husband and I said, “I’m thinking
about this.
How do you feel about this?”
And my husband is also a writer, and he just
said go for it.
He completely gave me permission.
And during the course of writing that book,
part of my process is that I share work with
him every day.
I read aloud to him at night.
I’ve done that with novels, I’ve done
that with memoirs.
Over the course of 20 years, that’s what
I’ve done.
It was no different.
With Hourglass, I sat and read to him every
night.
And I really feel like he had veto power.
I completely felt like he had veto power.
If there was a sentence in there, a scene
in there, anything like that, and if he was
uncomfortable with it, I would’ve taken
it out.
That didn't happen.
In fact, there were times where he was encouraging
me to be harder on us and harder on him.
So I think that that really gave me a lot
of freedom and permission.
