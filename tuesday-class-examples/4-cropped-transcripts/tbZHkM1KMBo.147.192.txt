"HOW BEAUTIFUL A SCENE IS THAT?"
AND I HEARD IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO
COMPLETELY TO TAKE YOUR WIG OFF,
TAKE YOUR MAKEUP OFF...
- IT WAS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS SO ADAMANT ABOUT IT.
I WAS SO ADAMANT ABOUT IT.
I SAID, "LISTEN...
"SHE CAN'T GO TO BED
WITH HER WIG ON.
"SHE CANNOT BE IN THAT BEDROOM
WITH HER WIG ON
'CAUSE WOMEN DON'T GO TO BED
WITH THEIR WIGS ON."
AND I SAID, "A WHOLE PORTION
OF WOMEN OUT THERE
"ARE MARGINALIZED.
I WANT TO BE A REAL WOMAN.
LET'S GO FOR IT.
I'M A CHARACTER ACTRESS."
[audience cheers]
OKAY?
CHARACTER ACTRESS.
BUT LISTEN...
- [laughs]
- BY THE TIME
WE GOT TO THE SCENE
WITH ALL THE CREW MEMBERS
AROUND ME,
TAKING MY WIG OFF AND MY MAKEUP,
YOU KNOW,
I SAID, "OKAY, MAYBE
I SHOULD HAVE RETHOUGHT THIS."
- YEAH.
- I SAID,
"CAN I KEEP MY LASHES ON?"
- NOPE.
NO, I LOVED IT.
