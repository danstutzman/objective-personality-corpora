DANI SHAPIRO, Author, "Inheritance: A Memoir
of Genealogy": On a winter night three years
ago, my husband told me that he had decided
to take a DNA test.
He was curious.
That's all.
He asked me if I wanted him to order me one
too.
I wasn't curious.
I knew exactly where I came from, but I said,
sure.
Why not?
It seemed like no big deal.
Prices had come way down.
Families everywhere were giving each other
DNA kits as holiday gifts.
When my results came back, they revealed that
my late beloved father had not been my biological
father.
In rapid succession, using nothing more than
Facebook and Google searches, I learned that
I had been conceived in an institute in Philadelphia,
and that my biological father had been a sperm
donor.
Within 36 hours, I found that sperm donor,
who had been a young medical student at the
time.
He was now a retired 78-year-old doctor, a
medical ethicist.
He was more than a little bit surprised to
hear from me.
A secret was scrupulously kept from me for
54 years.
Secrets defined the world of infertility and
reproductive medicine at the time, something
that persists to this day.
Couples were told to have sex before and after
the procedure, so that they'd never really
be sure who the father was, and to then to
go home and forget it ever happened, to never
breathe a word, not to family, not to friends.
The child would never know.
And what we don't know doesn't hurt us.
Except that I believe that what we don't know
absolutely does hurt us.
I grew up with a powerful sense that something
wasn't quite right.
Things didn't add up.
I didn't add up.
I looked very different from my family, but
that was only a small part of it.
There were ways in which I simply was different.
But I didn't know why.
So I did what children do.
I felt there must be something wrong with
me.
That feeling of wrongness permeated my life,
even as I was able to thrive as a writer,
marry, and have a child of my own.
There was always a subtle disconnect, as if
the wires were crossed.
I wrote book after book, trying to understand
why this was the case.
We're living in a time when family secrets
are tumbling out at a stunning rate.
Easy, popular DNA testing along with the Internet
makes it nearly inevitable that secrets involving
family and identity won't make it to the grave.
And that's a good thing, because no matter
how high up on a shelf a secret is kept, it's
still there.
Just because it isn't spoken doesn't mean
it doesn't exist.
Quite the opposite.
It's all the more powerful and dangerous for
having been hidden.
