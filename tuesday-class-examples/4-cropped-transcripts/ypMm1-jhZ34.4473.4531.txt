actually moving home or were you ranting
with me no no okay so you get two major
decisions you know this is children of
immigrants we have two major decisions
who we love and what we choose to do
I'll say that again who we love
ie who you marry that's a big deal in
our community and what you do so there
was a quick those are your bros
different than white Sally I'm asking
I'm asking because at 18 the majority of
my American friends yes you're free to
do whatever you're literally forced to
move out of the house so those two areas
indoors I understand okay I understand
we are property of our fathers I am
property of Nadja me manage you don't
mean it was a big fight to be right this
is who I'm marrying and this
what I'm choosing to do it was a fight
because immigrant parents are like no no
II I own you
fuck you talking about your choosing I
own you let you do what I want
I totally this is my thing though your
two big battles are those two battles
don't worry about the money
don't worry about all that stuff you
have to do those two things on your own
terms and you got an air mattress it if
you really love it
otherwise you're a fair-weather film fan
that's the way it's gonna or or actually
