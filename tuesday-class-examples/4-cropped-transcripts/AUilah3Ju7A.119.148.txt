I'm always nervous that
they're somehow unhappy.
Now, I don't know why I feel compelled
to tell you guys this, but I do.
You know, I'm the kind of person that is
always worried that
everyone is mad at them
and I'm the kind of person that gets
really excited about an idea
and then if I share it with you
and you respond negatively,
or shut me down,
I have no internal reinforcement
to still be excited about that idea.
My internal monologue
immediately switches to,
"That was dumb, and bad, Hannah.
"You're dumb and bad."
