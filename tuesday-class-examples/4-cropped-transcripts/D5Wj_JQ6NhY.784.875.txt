>> Well, I guess I'm
wondering because the state
of North Carolina has actually
taken the Hand Maid's Tale off
the required
reading list.
>> Oh people have done
that all over the place.
>> Saying that it's
anti-religion
and it's anti-Bible.
>> Then they haven't read it
very carefully, have they?
They missed the Lord's Prayer
spoken by the central character,
didn't they?
>> They did.
>> Yeah, slightly differently
worded but okay let's talk
about this because it's
important.
Religion can be a positive faith
that helps and encourages people
and comforts then in time of
trouble.
Or it can be a hammer to hit
people over the head with.
>> Just the way it's often used.
>> Often. Used by those who
want more power for themselves.
So those are -- those two things
have pretty much always been
true.
And it's probably also true
that the impulse to religion
or like I say the impulse to
believe
in an invisible power greater
than yourself, that is probably
an evolved adaptation and people
are going
to do it whether you
want them to or not.
That invisible thing bigger
than themselves may be the stock
market having a lot of people
believe in that.
>> Interesting.
>> Or it may be quote science,
that big thing that's invisible
that's bigger than yourself.
There all sorts of things
that people believe in
and that may not necessarily
be an established religion
but they all do it in
one way or another.
>> Well, speaking of science and
you may be bored with this
question.
