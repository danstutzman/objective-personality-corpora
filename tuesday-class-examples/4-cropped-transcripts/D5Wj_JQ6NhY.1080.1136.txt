When they started writing
this kind of thing.
Joel Varen [phonetic] who
started with,
what we would now call
speculative fiction, considered
that he was writing
about things that might really
happen.
And --
>> Could happen.
>> Could, could and he expected
them to.
He was writing about submarines
and air travel and things
that he fully expected would
happen.
And guess what?
They did. Maybe not quite the
way he pictured it but they
happened.
>> Yeah, you've written about
meat being grown in Petri dishes
and pagoons.
>> All those --
>> Organs that come from pigs
and are transplanted to humans.
Things that now are headlines
in newspapers.
>> I know but I knew all --
I knew back when I started
that people were working
on those things.
They just hadn't succeeded yet.
One of the latest is they've put
some human cortex tissue into
mice.
That's all we needed.
Smarter mice.
Thanks. Don't let them out.
