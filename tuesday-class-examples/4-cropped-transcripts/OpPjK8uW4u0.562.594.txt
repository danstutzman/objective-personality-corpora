a a back like a real battle for me yeah
going on a date was like the fuckin like
very much like with the movie yeah it's
Krabs is like these mundane ordinary
things can sometimes be the bravest
thing you can do exactly and that's what
the movie was trying to do is like
portray it very much they were lost for
30 I appreciate it it's like
thirteen-year-old life for a 13 year old
or someone with social anxiety every
tiny moments feel like life and death
and it is it's so important to overcome
it and just say you know what I still
have to do this and I feel like that is
really what makes you overcome it yes
