I can't tell you how much better my life is
and anybody watching this will be if you wake
up every single day and you take 10 minutes.
I have yellow notepads sitting all around
my house.
I got that from Bill [00:13:30] Gates.
Bill Gates built Microsoft at 17 by locking
himself up in a hotel room with six yellow
notepads and he wrote out the whole basic
code for dozen things that built Microsoft.
He became the richest man in the world.
18 years straight because he was organized
enough to lock himself in a room and think
through his day.
What I try to do and whenever I do this, I
have a great day.
Whenever I don't, I notice it.
Be organized a little bit, 10 minutes.
I actually have this little couch thing outside
of my shower and I put a notepad [00:14:00]
by it.
I take a shower when I wake up, I walk over
to it, I sit there and I just write out.
I mean it can be as little as three main projects
you want to get done that day.
Organization is the other 25%.
