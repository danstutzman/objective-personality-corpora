- Yeah, so do you think,
the other thing that you,
I was reading an article,
it was not your book,
but it was a recent interview
where you were talking
about that goes along
with this, about every 10,
it's been 10 years since the recession.
- Yeah.
- Do you think, one of my mentors told me,
said, "Ty, about every
every seven to 10 years,
something comes along."
Do you think we're potentially
cruising for a bruisin' here?
- Absolutely, and I've
been sayin' this in,
you know, all kind of
interviews as I been out
talkin' about the book,
and what happens is,
and everybody wants to talk about the GNP
and all the barometers of a recession,
it's really simple, okay?
We tend to overbuild
everything in good times
and we've been on a building spree.
Just look at LA, Houston, New York,
we've built so many apartments,
so many houses, so many cars,
so many restaurant seats,
so much retail and what happens is,
the consumer finally gets full and can't
eat any more, and so what happens,
you need a recession to let
everything catch up again
and so there's supply and
demand for everything,
from TV's to cars to restaurants
to apartments to homes.
And that's where we are right now.
The consumer is full,
and that's why all of a sudden
you saw the manufacturing
numbers slow down today
and that's as easy as I can put it.
We're full right now, we're all fat.
