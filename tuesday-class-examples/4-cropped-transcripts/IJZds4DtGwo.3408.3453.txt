humble than I am and they constantly
keep me in check you know yeah and I one
of the things I loved about your
thoughts on that question is how you
part of your answer was in the form of a
question where you consider like that I
lead with my ego or was that just
confidence and I love your lack of
certainty around that part to me that's
like the to me a sense of certainty is
almost the sign of like for mental
health but the sign of curiosity for me
is the sign of a healthy ego and then
you know surrounding yourself with
people who you know you trust who care
genuinely for you not what you're doing
but more for you that's
it's very it's very important for me as
well yeah so who knows it's a fun
