there's nothing lay down with the roll
of toilet paper right here 1968 where I
turned my life around and I kind of made
a deal with God I just kind of said look
if you let me die with some dignity I'll
say your name every day and I will do
whatever I can for my fellow man I said
but I thought it'd only be like a live
six or seven months with God for let you
out and you make it all right yeah yeah
and you get back to the community I know
that you take your cars and stuff to
at-risk youth any time somebody has a
fundraiser or anything like that it's
like we're there right or not and it's
funny it's like people think that oh you
mean I can do a good deed and get paid
now it's it's like you become that
person you have to become that person
