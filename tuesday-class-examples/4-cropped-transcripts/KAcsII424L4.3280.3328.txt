an ice pick up above your eyes and
wiping out your frontal lobe so it's
it's not I'm not pining for the Nobel
Prize right the thing that gives me joy
and meaning purpose is not being better
than other people
it's being the best I can be and having
the most meaningful existence I learn
that so when I was in college I was
generally the top student in my class
but I helped everybody else I was never
about I need to be better than you I
wanted us both to be our best and oh by
the way if I helped you study it's
reinforcing the information for me
so hans selye a was a very famous stress
researcher and he it's a term he called
egoistic altruism it's mean when I help
you I'm also helping me yeah absolutely
