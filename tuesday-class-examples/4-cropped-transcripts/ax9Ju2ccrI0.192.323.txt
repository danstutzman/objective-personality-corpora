>> Stephen: "WHAT THE EVENING
NEWS NOW."
HAS IT CHANGED THE WAY YOU LOOK
AT THE WORLD.
>> YES.
AND I THINK IT'S FOR THE BETTER.
I WAS A KIDS' BIRTHDAY PARTY--
THERE WERE GROWN-UPS-- THERE
WERE GROWN-UPS THERE.
>> Stephen: YOU WEREN'T JUST
STOPPING BY A KID'S BIRTHDAY
PARTY AND GOING, WHAT, ARE WE
DOING?
PIN THE TAIL ON THE DONKEY?
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS!"
 (  LAUGHTER  ).
>> THE DONKEY OR A BUTT?
NO WORD LOVERS OUT THERE.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS I DIDN'T HOP
A FENCE.
THERE WERE OTHER --
>> Stephen: SURE.
>> THERE WERE OTHER GROWN-UPS
THERE.
AND THERE WERE THESE KIDS.
THEY WERE EIGHT, OR NINE- OR
10-YEAR-OLD KIDS AND THEY WERE
PLAYING TAG.
AND I SAW A LITTLE ONE, LIKE A
LITTLE ME, YOU KNOW, HE WAS
SOFT, KIND OF SWEATY.
AND I'M BIGOMY.
AND HE'S LITTLE ME.
AND I'M AT THE SNACK TABLE, AND
LITTLE ME COMES OVER BECAUSE
HE'S LITTLE ME.
AND WE'RE LODING UP ON BUGLES.
AND WE HAD THIS NIGHT NOOIS
MOMENT WHEN HE LOOKED AT ME AND
I LOOKED AT HIM AND HE KNEW I
WAS HIM LATER.
AND HE WAS ME BEFORE.
>> Stephen: SURE, SURE.
>> AND I JUST KIND OF SENT HIM A
MESSAGE TELEPATHICALLY LIKE, BE
FUNNY."
AND THEN, SO LITTLE ME WAS
EATING.
AND THEN THIS OTHER SPORTY KID,
THIS, LIKE NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY
WITH RECKLESS HAIR, RAN UP AND--
I THINK THAT'S SO FUNNY, TOO--
HE TAGGED LITTLE ME.
THEY WERE PLAYING TAG.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
AND AFTER HE TAGGED LITTLE ME,
LITTLE ME WENT, "OOOH!
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!"
 (  LAUGHTER  )
SO HE WAS LOOKING FOR A BATHROOM
BREAK.
HE WAS CARBOLOADING ON HIS WAY
TO THE BATHROOM.
 ( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH
--
>> Stephen: HOW LONG HE WAS
GOING TO BE IN THERE.
>> YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S
GOING TO BE.
YOU CAN'T RISK THAT.
LITTLE ME LOOKED AT ME AND
CHASED AFTER THE SPORTY KID
BECAUSE HE WAS BOUND BY THE
CONTRACT OF THE GAME OF TAG.
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S SO
STUPID.
DON'T YOU SEE IT'S SO STUPID.
OF THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED, THIS
IS THE PERSPECTIVE.
THAT'S HOW KIDS SEE US.
IN THE MORNING WHEN WE'RE LIKE,
"WHERE ARE MY KEYS!"
LIKE FREAKING OUT.
KIDS ARE THERE LOOKING AT US
JUST GOING, "DON'T YOU SEE, IT'S
ALL A GAME, MAN?"
>> Stephen: THAT'S THE BUGLE.
>> THIS IS A BUGLE.
