>> MY NEW FRIEND, STEPHEN, WHAT
THEY SHOULD, IF YOU WANT TO GIVE
PREGNANT PEOPLE ADVICE IS,
"DON'T GO OUT NOW.
WATCH DARK MOVIES AND TELEVISION
NOW."
>> Stephen: OH, RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE AFTER YOU HAVE A
BABY, YOU'RE SO PROTECTIVE OF
THE BABY, YOU DON'T WANT TO
WATCH ANYTHING DARK.
SO THAT'S ADVICE.

MAID'S TALE NOW."
"WATCH TRUE DETECTIVES SEASON 1
AND THREE NOW."
>> Stephen: "WHAT THE EVENING
NEWS NOW."
