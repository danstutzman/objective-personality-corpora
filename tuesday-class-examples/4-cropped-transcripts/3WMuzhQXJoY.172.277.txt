After my year of filming,
I was reviewing the 100 hours
of footage I had gathered,
replaying and transcribing it,
which believe me when I say
no one will ever listen to you more
than someone who transcribes your words.
You should write that down.
(Laughter)
So,
I was typing out every word meticulously,
and through that process,
I began to realize
that my initial knee-jerk reactions
to certain statements
weren't really warranted,
and my feeling offended
did not hold up to intense scrutiny.
Was that statement about men
having built the skyscrapers
and the bridges anti-women?
I thought, well, what would
be the gender-reverse scenario?
Maybe a feminist saying:
Just look around,
everyone you see was birthed by a woman.
Wow!
That's a powerful statement.
And it's true.
Is it anti-male?
I don't think so.
I think it's acknowledging our unique
and valued contributions to our society.
Well, luckily,
while I was making The Red Pill movie,
I kept a video diary which ended up
tracking my evolving views,
and in looking back on the 37 diaries
I recorded that year,
there was a common theme.
I would often hear
an innocent, valid point
that a men's rights activist would make,
but in my head,
I would add on to their statements,
a sexist or anti-woman spin,
assuming that's what they
wanted to say but didn't.
