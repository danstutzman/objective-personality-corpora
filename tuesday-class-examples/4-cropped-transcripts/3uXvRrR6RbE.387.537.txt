SO I HAVE BEEN TRACKING HER
CAREER.
>> Stephen: SO WHAT WAS IT
LIKE TO WORK WITH HER AND WRITE
SOMETHING FOR HER AND WORK WITH
HER?
WAS THAT NERVING RACKING OR JUST
SORT OF JOYFUL?
>> IT WAS SORT OF SERVE RACKING,
BUT THE THING WITH EMMA IS -- I
DON'T KNOW, YOU'VE MET HER --
SHE JUST PLOWS THROUGH
NERVOUSNESS AND WANTS EVERYONE
TO BE COMFORTABLE.
WHEN YOU WORK WITH YOUNG
ACTRESSES NEW IN THE BUSINESS, A
LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T WANT TO
SAY WHAT THEY REALLY FEEL ABOUT
THINGS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
TO OFFEND ANYONE.
>> StepheANYONE.
-- THE MARRIOTT HOTEL.
>> Stephen: MY WATCH GOT A
CALL AND I FORGOT TO PUT IT TO
SLEEP, IT WAS FROM MARRIOTT
HOTEL.
>> YOUR AWARDS PROGRAM FROM
MARRIOTT INTERRUPTED MY TOUCHING
STORY ABOUT EMMA THOMPSON.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
WAIT A SECOND!
HOLD ON A SECOND!
I HAVE SO MANY -- YOU ARE RICH!
WHY DO YOU NEED A REWARDS
PROGRAM?
>> Stephen: THIS IS HOW YOU
GET RICH.
YOU GO FOR THE REWARDS.
EXACTLY.
I ALSO STEAL ROLLS.
>> I HAVE SO MANY MORE QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION.
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T USE A REWARDS PROGRAM!
>> Stephen: HERE'S THE
THING --
>> NO, NO, HERE'S THE THING, HE
HAS THE NUMBER ONE SHOW ON TV,
AND HE'S, LIKE, OH, GOT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IF I TRAVEL, THAT ME
AND MY WIFE AND MY THREE
CHILDREN ARE BEING HOSTED IN AN
ECONOMICAL WAY!
( LAUGHTER )
YOU GET PUT UP EVERYWHERE!
>> Stephen: SURE, SURE, BUT WE
CAN UPGRADE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
I'M IN A MOVIE WITH EMMA
THOMPSON, LIKE, WHO CARES.
WHATEVER.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: I PUT MY HAND OVER
IT KNOWING IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND
OVER IT IT TELLS IT TO GO AWAY.
>> REALLY SUBTLE!
>> Stephen: I TRIED.
I WAS TRYING!
I WAS TRYING!
CAN WE PLAY BACK THE MOMENT WHEN
I WAS TRYING TO DO THAT?
SO SORRY, PLEASE ACCEPT MY
APOLOGY.
I WAS TRYING TO DO THIS SO IT
WOULD STOP AND GO, DAMN DID I
JUST ANSWER THE PHONE ON MY
WRIST?
AND I THOUGHT, WELL, WE'LL KNOW
IN A MOMENT IF THEY START
TALKING.
>> YOU KNOW WHEN THIS ENDS HE
WILL BE SCRAMBLING, LIKE, OH, I
HOPE I STILL GOT THE REWARDS!
HOPE I DIDN'T DELETE THAT!
