- Yes.
- As we try to come through this
'cause what I want really
is for you to come through
'cause I know who you really are
and so, what I want you
to do is come through this
with a different way because you Mo'nique,
you my girl!
I love you like a sister.
I hate what's happening to you.
I hate what they're
saying that's not true!
I want them to know that you are caring,
that you're a great mother,
that you are incredible talent.
I don't like the fact that
you've been black balled.
