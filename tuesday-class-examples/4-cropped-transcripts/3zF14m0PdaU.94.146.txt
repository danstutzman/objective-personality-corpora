people look at us as if we're different
but different in a bad way so one day
I'm in a restaurant and I'm in the
bathroom giving myself an injection and
this woman walks in and sees me
finishing up and putting my injection
away and I walk out and at the end of
our meal I get up to walk past her and I
overhear her say to her companion she's
a drug addict
and I stopped and I was embarrassed and
I turned around and I walked back to the
woman and said I'm not a drug addict I'm
a diabetic and you saw me taking insulin
which is a drug that saves my life don't
presume the worst in people who do
different things I asked I ended with
