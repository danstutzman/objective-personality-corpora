So many times, people step onto my canvas
and their life, and I'll say the word life
to them looks chaotic and out of order.
And I get this question asked a lot.
How do I bring order to
the chaos in my life?
First and foremost, we
have to break down life.
Because life really is a
really big conversation
and looking at it in its
totality could really
be overwhelming, which is why most people
don't ever start to do anything to resolve
and to minimize or diminish the chaos
or reduce the chaos.
So let's first break down life
because life is made up of quadrants.
So you have your health and your wellness,
identify where is the chaos there?
Because all of a sudden it
becomes bite-size and digestible.
Your finances, where is the chaos there?
What does it look like
and what's creating it?
Your relationship, now
in your relationships,
that has four sub-categories.
So in your romantic relationship,
is there chaos there?
In your familial relationships,
is there chaos there?
In your colleague and work relationship,
is there chaos there?
And in your community
relationships, neighbors,
friends, is there chaos there?
So first, before you can manage the chaos
in your life, let's break it down
so you could see it much more clearly
than just my life is chaotic.
That's a really big
overwhelming tsunami, right?
So let's break it down
so that it's baby waves.
And we can manage a wave or a speed bump
