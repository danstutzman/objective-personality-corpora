could just like a synonym could just be
paid paying attention yeah so every
moment throughout your day is an
opportunity to pay greater attention to
what's the mechanics of my body what's
the mechanics of my breath you know in
my house my vision am i focusing staring
up into a cell phone all day that
literally stresses me out and
potentially induces things like myopia
and no or am I looking out into the
distance and giving myself and maybe
take a nice long breath out you know and
I'm aware of physical contact well I
haven't been touched or touched for
three days you know within that I
appreciate that that felt nice failure
