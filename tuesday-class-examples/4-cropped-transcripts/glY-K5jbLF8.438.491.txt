Oh, delay?
Thank you.
Because suffering is the only way we get things
done.
Richard Rohr says, "You only change through
suffering, otherwise, why would you change?
Why would you change?"
It's working.
You're going around being an asshole.
[GARBLED WORDS] And it's working, it's paying
out.
You're getting a job, you're getting a car,
you're getting love, you're getting food,
you're getting whatever.
You need to suffer.
Something has to happen that needs to be something
that takes you out of yourself and goes--
not just about Tony Robbins-ing yourself and
being like, I've been selfish.
Something that breaks you out of your identification
with the story and your own belief in your
worthiness that's based on other people's
opinion of you.
Fuck that shit.
Fuck that shit.
100 years, all new people.
You've gotta be worth something more than
just the thoughts of the mammals that happen
to be walking around on this space rock right
now.
That sucks.
That's a winless game.
It's a waste of time.
