and you've got a good team this year.
So question from your book,
"Shut Up and Listen",
great title by the way,
you talked about knowing
your numbers, right?
So we now live in a world,
I'm in the middle of it,
social media, everybody's
become an entrepreneur,
which in many ways is good,
and people wanna think big,
they believe in secret and
all these big picture things
like I'm gonna succeed,
but when I read your book,
there's two things that stand out.
One is know your numbers,
meaning you've gotta have
technical skill, you have to pay attention
to the business.
In your experience, you had a TV show,
you've seen so many business owners,
what percentage of business
owners know their number?
- None, really, a lot,
all your successful ones.
And the unsuccessful ones
don't know their numbers
and I don't care how good your product is,
if you don't know your
numbers, and I can talk
to somebody for a minute and a half
and start quizzin' you
about your business,
and I can know real quick, you know,
how much is your receivables,
what's your payables,
what is your cost of sales,
what is your labor cost?
And if they don't know those numbers,
they're gonna go out of business
unless they just happen to have a product
that is just flying off
the shelf everywhere.
- Right, yeah.
- Because you have to know
your numbers to be successful.
