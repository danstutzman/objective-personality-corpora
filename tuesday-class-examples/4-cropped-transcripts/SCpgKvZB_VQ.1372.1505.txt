"Leadership is not to be
pleased by the moment."
But your most prominent
critic at the moment
is the president of the United States.
People are even saying
that he may be willing
to prepare initiatives to break up Amazon
because it's too big, it's too successful,
it's too dominant in too many sectors
or for other reasons.
First of all, is this scenario
of a break of something
that you take seriously
or you think it's just a fantasy?
- For me, again, this
is one of those things
where I focus on
and ask our teams to focus
on what we can control
and I expect,
whether it's the current US administration
or any other government
agency anywhere in the world
Amazon is now a large corporation
and I expect us to be scrutinized,
we should be scrutinized,
I think all large institutions
should be scrutinized and examined,
it's reasonable.
One thing to note about us
is that we have gotten
big in absolute terms
only very recently.
So we've always been growing
fast in percentage terms
but in 2010 just eight years ago,
we had 30,000 employees.
So in the last eight years
we've gone from 30,000
employees to 560,000 employees.
So for us, it's kind of,
in my mind, I'm still
delivering the packages
to the post office myself,
you see what I'm saying?
I still have all the memories
of hoping that one day we
could afford a forklift.
And so obviously that's
my intellectual brain
knows that's just not the case anymore,
we have 560,000 employees
all over the world
and I know we should be scrutinized
and I think it's true
of big government institutions
should be scrutinized,
big non profit institutions
should be scrutinized,
big universities should be scrutinized,
it just makes sense.
And that's by the way,
why the work that the Washington Post
and the other great
newspapers around the world do
is so important
because they're often the ones
doing that initial scrutiny
even before the government agencies do.
