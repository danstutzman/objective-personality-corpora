You know what I mean?
I grew up with a pretty
fucked up background
and because of that, I had this constant,
I guess, doubt that I
ever knew what was right.
And I would let myself suck things up,
and ignore things that felt wrong to me,
or that I didn't really agree with,
or I didn't really like,
because I didn't believe
that I knew what was really right.
But what I'm learning, and maybe
this applies to some of you, I don't know,
but it applies to me and and
I gotta get it off my chest,
that if you come from an unorthodox,
non-traditional background,
which more and more people do,
you still know what you value,
and what value you have.
And you still know how
you want to treat others,
and how you want to be treated.
And you might be right,
and other people might be wrong,
and just because you come from a place
that maybe wasn't the
healthiest environment,
doesn't mean that you don't have a shot
to be a super healthy person.
So, no judging.
You know why I wear
shirts like this, guys?
You know why I say the stuff I do?
It's like, I don't say, "No judging,"
and I don't say, "Practice
reckless optimism,"
and I don't say all this stuff
because it's me telling you.
It's not me being like,
"Hey guys, don't forget:
"No judging. I've got
this shit in the bag."
No, I'm putting this on
a shirt and wearing it
to remind myself, my
super judgmental self,
"Hannah, no judging. Calm down."
Ya know?
