So I just was curious as to
how you get to be you, sitting
in the greatest wealth on
Earth, and not be confused
by money's measures and merit.
Well, I think it probably
comes from the fact
that I grew up in a very middle
class family in Dallas, Texas.
And we were working very hard
to have enough money to send
the four of us kids to college.
And we knew my dad's
engineer salary wasn't
going to pay for all of it.
And so we had--
they had a property
real estate business.
And we were cleaning
ovens and cleaning
out people's messes
when they left over
and running the finances.
I kept the books.
And I think growing up in that
sort of middle class family
with this dream of
going to college,
you remember how important it
is to get a great education.
Like, my parents were determined
I would get a good education.
But it set my values.
I mean, that, and
my parents sent me
to an all-girls
Catholic high school.
I kind of wanted to go to a
different all-girls school
that was more academic.
But that social justice
grounding I got in high school,
it just helped me really
wrestle with my values early.
And then I would say lastly,
having three children,
you constantly have to
be thinking, what am I
teaching my children that I want
them to live out in the world?
And am I living my life that
way, by what I say and I do?
And so it always, always,
always goes back to your values.
And so I just--
I don't see myself as any
different than anybody else.
I'm this young girl who
grew up in a middle class
family in Dallas, Texas.
