emotional personal pain that brought to
me of course
and so as patients got better because I
had more information I'm like I have to
do this again well today we have a
hundred and fifty thousand scans that
we've done on patients from a hundred
and twenty countries so I'm completely
addicted because you know if you don't
look you don't know and we need to stop
lying about that but wholesale across
the u.s. really across the world you'll
go to your doctor you say I'm depressed
I'm anxious I can't sleep I have temper
problems I'm obsessiveness and within a
twenty minute office visit you leave
with prescriptions for anxiety
depression sleep and that's insane when
no one has looked at your brain so you
don't know does it work too hard or not
hard enough is it toxic from drug abuse
or from mold in your home or is it
traumatic because you played a contact
sport and it damaged your frontal lobes
and so I have been on this crusade
