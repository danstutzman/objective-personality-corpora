be born as we did it frustrating for
people who not gwyneth because she can
look at a piece of paper and then go
okay I get it and she's got it all
memorized she's amazing
but what's for the highest good
sometimes it's very self-indulgent to
come in and like you know hand out new
pages or say oh I'm not saying that so
feed me that way you know what I mean
you need an environment of respect but I
like I like discovering things how much
