We're going to finish the lighting.
I'm aiming at getting our
first shot off at 10:00 AM.
- I have my Fitbit on
with my heartrate monitor.
I'm going to keep track of
that and keep it mellow.
- Watch the gowns with the coffee.
Okay, no, watch the bottom,
watch the bottom of the gowns.
- Oh Lord.
- Yeah, okay, just be careful.
- Have mercy on us.
- Try to get on for first shot at 11 now.
That's my goal.
so I want to get it centered
because this is going to be
how it's lying.
There's a black spot right there.
Can we move that black spot?
What is that?
Is that lint?
Like a quarter inch back,
no, it was a little too--
No, like an eighth of an
inch, just a little bit
to your right, Shayne, just a tiny bit.
No, you're just rotating it.
Caroline, lift with him and
pull it slightly to your right,
Shayne, very slightly, stop.
- Like right now?
Oh, Jesus.
- The first shot will
be when the first shot
decides to happen.
Just got to make sure it's all perfect.
That was a ninja move.
- Yeah, it was, I saw that.
- It's kind of watery, it's okay.
- Cool.
- Thank you for making this.
Jazzmine!
No, this is the Thai jewelry.
There should be a Ralph's
paper bag that has
all of the jewelry in it.
- I'll go re-look for you.
- I would sprint and make sure it's there.
Oh, here we go
- [Voiceover] Yay!
- God, my brain, this is like
$10,000 worth of jewelry.
Can we take the zebra stripes off of that?
I'm going to play the music
that it will actually be to.
All right.
- Hold on.
- [Eugene] And.
- Wait, how do I get out?
- Caroline, you good?
- Yes.
- Let's roll cameras.
Music.
You're actually on the
wedding aisle, okay?
You're walking down to
your husband right here
and action!
- Hi, my name is Michelle Hebert
and I'm one of the designers on set today.
- You're going to hit, hit, turn left.
Really breathe like boom, boom, boom.
- [Jazzmine] Why isn't Eugene in a dress?
- You always want to be
kind of like 31ish degrees
- Okay.
- So it's not here and it's not like here,
it's like right there.
I think this should be lower, slightly.
I don't want to make the designer mad.
- Hi, I'm Kathryn Waldron
and I'm the makeup artist.
- He's very professional
but he's freaking crazy.
- Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, yes, yes!
All your jewelry feels so good
but you can't have it because it's mine
because I'm the queen of Thailand.
Whatever, loser, flip out, good, yes!
Cut.
You guys are good on that camera, right?
- Yes.
- [Eugene] All right, let's switch lenses.
- I'm the designer for the Afghan clothes.
- So one of the models was
too thin for the dresses
so they called me in.
- And turn to camera and pose.
Oh, wow.
I'm Sofia, I'm not a model,
I don't know how to model.
You were amazing.
- I'm the designer for
the Vietnamese bride.
- Circle, right?
Perfect, perfect, perfect.
And set, model.
We are over halfway through now.
You are all doing an amazing job.
- My mom's designs for the
traditional Korean dress.
- Yeah, you are working
that dress, beautiful.
For Korea! Turn!
- I'm here to provide henna design.
- You know who the queen
is, oh yes, it's you.
You can exit, get out of there.
Whatever bitches.
One more time.
I want you to really sell this last stare.
Walk away and stare at them.
Stare at them, stare
at them, stare at them.
Turn, yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
And, cut.
That's a wrap.
Yeah!
Let's get you out of
those gorgeous clothes
and into like a pizza box, I'm hungry.
- I want to learn more about big sets
and how we can use this space to create.
Sorry, it's late.
I can't think very well.
- I'm taking away like
opening up people's minds
and I'm really passionate
about that as well.
- I know I can be a
bit of an ass sometimes
but, you know, that's just Asian parenting
rule number one.
You know?
You've got to be strict.
You've got to get everything down because
in the end, they're going to succeed
and they succeeded today, they were great.
