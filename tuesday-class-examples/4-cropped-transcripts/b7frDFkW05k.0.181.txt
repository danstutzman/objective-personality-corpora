I am so nervous and excited about today
That's because today, I am so happy to announce
For the first time in fours years, I am an independent creator again.
I am so thankful to Group 9, Discovery Digital Networks
For the experiences I had, the amazing people I was able to work with
but this is a necessary, and I feel, important change
I want to make the next great news network
A network that is run under my vision of "it is okay to have and share opinions, but let's get the facts right first
let's express what both sides are actually saying, give their POV
And then separately, after we've presented them in the best and fair manner, then yes
then we share our opinion, not because we want people to also think like we think, to INFECT MINDS
WITH MY WAY CUZ MY WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY, no,
but to start a conversation about this crazy world that we live in.
we often close the doors on people who think differently or say different things because we associate
those people with the most extreme of that group, of the most ridiculous who maybe share those same ideas.
and there needs to be a rational place where we can come together and talk about the world
in a place where we trust what's actually being fed to us
And that's why today, I'm launching "Defranco Elite"
a fan-funding initiative through Patreon
I wanna do it independently to make sure no corporate interest can manipulate
and control how the news is presented
being forced to talk about a topic or not being able to talk about a topic
or having to push some sort of agenda
strings can't be there if I truly want
to create this and I say that having
been offered to be a part of something
much bigger than what I'm doing now is
to build someone else's property or to
even go with my vision but still be able
to be controlled I would have the level
of control needed to actually deliver on
what I'm talking about right I want to
have a real impact on this world and I
feel like there are people like you that
also crave that and that's why to me
it's a no-brainer not to only make
content for you but with you keep in
mind I am taking one of the biggest
risks of my career and one of the most
toxic and uncertain of time ad revenue
for people that talk about real and
controversial topics is plummeting
monetization being stripped from my
videos is a very real problem and one
that looks to get worse in the future
despite our continued growth for people
hungry for this content it's more and
more uncertain but I do this because I
know that this is important and I know
what we can truly do that's why separate
from this fan funding obviously I'm
investing in this myself risking what I
have personally because I think we can
make something amazing buy my properties back
building out new sets so I can move
past the current rate and quality of
production bringing in new incredibly
talented
people behind and in front of the camera
new faces an old making old formats
better and introducing new this is going
to take time just because we launch this
campaign doesn't mean boom the news
network exists last thing I want to do
is over promise blow smoke up your ass
and disappoint you plan is to build out
on a to existing channel take the monday
to thursday philip defranco show and get
that to seven days a week
take the philly d channel from two
videos a week to five this will be the
place where i not only start giving you
more play so we can test new format
shows host any people getting this
aren't is going to be the people that
are supporting us through this fan funding
yes by showing us that support you're
going to get perks and benefits and then
special early releases you get to be
part of live streams and be the first to
know about events but the goal here is
to make something for everyone by building
it out this way not only can i give you
more content now but will be able to
test organically to see what works and
what we want the news networks to be
learning lessons and picking up
amazingly talented people along the way
