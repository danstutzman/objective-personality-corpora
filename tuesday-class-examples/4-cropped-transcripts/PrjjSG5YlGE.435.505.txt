Or was it a blend, where you kind of danced
in between?
For me, it starts with the location.
The first thing is New York City, 1940s, I
have to learn the theater world, I have to
learn everything about it.
As I start researching, the characters come
to me.
So, I'll get inspired by something that I
read.
I'll be like, "Oh, it'd be so cool to have
a character whose sort of like that."
Somebody who's referenced in a letter that
I would read who is a playwright visiting
from LA and complaining that New York City
is terrible in white shoes.
That kind of guy.
Like a dandy, bon vivant.
I'm like, "Oh, we could put something like
that."
So, it starts to people itself.
And then for me, weirdly, the last piece of
it that I have is the actual story.
First, I have the setting, then I have the
people and then I have to figure out, what
are those people doing in that setting and
what is the story I want to tell here?
And in this case, what I've written is kind
of a mystery because it starts, the whole
book is an answer to a mysterious question
where this woman whose now in her nineties
gets a letter from we don't know who, from
a woman saying, "Now that my mother is dead,
I'm wondering if you'd be comfortable telling
me what you were to my father."
And the whole book is her answer of what she
was to this mysterious man and we don't quite
know who he is and it takes a long time to
get there.
But I kind of wanted to tell a mystery story
as well.
And did you, so again, this is...
