Scott Cooper who directed crazy heart
because it was his first time and at one
point in shooting that movie we were
doing the scene it was just a little
scene and we done it a couple of times
and he just came over to me I was like
so excited and he just went I love you
and it wasn't creepy and it was it was
just he did love me and and I loved him
and I it's like if you feel loved
if you feel seen then you can relax and
you could work and when that's withheld
which sometimes certainly happens all
over the place even with great directors
it's much harder since we're talking
