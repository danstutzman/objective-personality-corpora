BUT IT SMOOTHED OUT.
>> Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED?
WHY DID IT START OFF ROUGH?
>> SO I WAS -- WITH SOME OF MY 
BUDDIES, I HAVE A LOST BUDDIES 
THAT ARE STUNTMEN IN HOLLYWOOD.
>> Jimmy: YOU DO?
>> YEAH.
WE HANG OUT AND TRY TO OUTDO 
EACH OTHER.
AND I THINK THEY GET TOGETHER 
BEFORE I CAN GET THERE AND SAY 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET HIM TO 
DO THIS.
ANYWAY, WE WERE AT MY HOUSE, AND
I WAS DOING A WHEELIE UP THE 
DRIVEWAY ON A MOTOCROSS BIKE, 
AND I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE 
DRIVEWAY AND FROM THE TIME I 
LEFT TO THE TIME I GOT BACK 
SOMEBODY APPARENTLY PUT A 
50-FOOT PALM TREE RIGHT AT THE 
TOP OF THE DRIVEWAY BECAUSE WHEN
I CAME DOWN IT WAS THERE.
>> Jimmy: YOU RAN INTO A PALM 
TREE DOING A WHEELIE.
AND NOBODY VIDEOTAPED THIS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> I CAME DOWN AND THE PALM TREE
WAS THERE, AND I HAD TO BAIL.
AND I DID BAIL.
AND I'M NO MINNOW.
>> Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE A BIG 
GUY.
>> AND WHEN I HIT THE GROUND 
THINGS WENT BACK.
>> Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
>> WELL, I BROKE SIX RIBS.
>> Jimmy: OH.
>> I CRUSHED THIS SHOULDER.
I HAD A LUNG CONTUSION.
AND IT WAS SOME SERIOUS STUFF.
>> Jimmy: DID IT EVER OCCUR TO 
YOU THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE 
DIRT-BIKING ANYMORE?
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 20 YOU 
COULD TAKE A BULLET IN THE 
SHOULDER AND, YOU KNOW, BY 
MORNING YOU'D KIND OF SHAKE IT 
OFF AND YOU'RE FINE.
NOW I GET A HANGNAIL AND IT'S A 
MONTH BEFORE YOU'RE ANY BETTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE.
SO I CALLED THIS FRIEND OF MINE 
WHO RUNS A MEDICAL IMAGING 
CENTER IN SANTA MONICA, DR. J 
ABOR.
"STAR WARS" PLACE OVER THERE.
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT, AND I 
CALLED HIM AND I SAID WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING?
HE SAID I'M IN A TUXEDO, I'M 
HOSTING A BIG DINNER, I'M 
GETTING READY TO LEAVE.
I SAID COULD YOU STOP BY THE 
OFFICE ON THE WAY AND CHECK ME 
OUT?
AND HE DID.
I GOT THERE, HIS WHOLE STAFF WAS
THERE.
I'M THERE THREE MINUTES, HE SAYS
WE'RE STOPPING THESE TESTS, YOU 
ARE -- YOU HAVE SIX BROKEN RIBS.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
IF YOU HAVE THREE BROKEN RIBS, 
THEY DIAGNOSE YOU AS RESPIRATORY
FAILURE.
HE SAID YOU'RE GOING IN THE 
HOSPITAL.
>> Jimmy: HE DID?
>> YEAH.
>> Jimmy: ARE YOU OKAY NOW?
>> COMPARED TO THEN, YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I'VE REALLY -- I'VE HEALED 
UP GREAT.
THEY COULDN'T OPERATE ON THE 
SHOULDER THEN BECAUSE MY LUNG 
WAS BLEEDING.
SO I WENT BACK AND FINISHED THE 
SEASON AND DID -- 
>> Jimmy: YOU DID?
>> YEAH.
I WENT BACK AND DID 25 SHOWS.
AND THEN AFTER THE LAST SHOW I 
WENT RIGHT FROM THE STAGE TO THE
HOSPITAL AND THEY OPERATED ON 
THE SHOULDER.
>> Jimmy: I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT 
A HERO YOU ARE.
>> OPENING THE STAGE DOORS -- 
OH, LISTEN, HERO MY ASS.
>> Jimmy: NO, I WAS KIDDING.
I WASN'T MEANING THAT REALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> NO, I KNOW.
I WASN'T GOING TO LET YOU HAVE 
THAT CHEAP SHOT.
BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU -- 
>> Jimmy: BUT YOU MADE IT WORSE 
IN A WAY.
>> THESE RED LIGHTS ON THE 
CAMERA, SOON AS THAT RED LIGHT 
OFF I WAS WHINING LIKE A 
10-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN A HAUNTED 
HOUSE.
>> Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> Jimmy: I HAVE A SHOW IDEA FOR
