Okay
Hey, I'm Kristen
and I like to quit stuff and not buy things and you've probably already guessed that I'm not gonna be critiquing the new iPhone X's
screen or lack of home button or wireless charging, I'm gonna be talking about
Cobalt which is a mineral that is present in most a lithium ion batteries that charge smartphones laptops
And even electric cars, so what's the problem with cobalt well according to the Washington Post
60% of the world's cobalt originates in Congo a country with extreme corruption and a long history of foreign
exploitation for its natural resources
The mining of cobalt isn't only extremely hazardous for the workers and even deadly
But it's also reportedly led to the forced relocation of villages and water pollution and according to Amnesty
International's report child labor has been used for the mining of cobalt as well as countless human rights abuses
Have been discovered. Death is a regular part of cobalt mining, but only mass casualties are reported. In
2015 13 cobalt miners were killed when a dirt tunnel collapsed in 2016 16 diggers were killed in a landslide
And then a few months later 15 more died in an underground fire, but again
these are only the reported mass casualties when
Individual deaths are added then the death toll is even higher, and then when it comes to child labour in 2012 UNICEF estimated that
40,000 boys and girls are working in Congo's mining industry and about
4,000 children miners are working in Kolwezi, a city in Congo that is steeped in cobalt these children often have no option
