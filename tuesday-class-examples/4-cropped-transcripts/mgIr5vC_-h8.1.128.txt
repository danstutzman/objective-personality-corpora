- Sex, beauty, modeling
campaign, you know?
- Yeah.
- But in your head you're
thinking bitch, bitch,
bitch, bitch, but it
comes across on your face
like really, really elegantly.
I'm Eugene Lee Yang and
I'm a video producer
at Buzzfeed Motion Pictures.
- Many people think that we're just actors
but we're actually also
writers, producers,
directors, editors.
We essentially do everything
from top to bottom
on a shoot.
I'm responsible for a
lot of the bigger hits
that we've had virally.
I am just very particular about how I want
my videos to come out.
The company is expecting
me to create one big
viral video per month
that will really just
knock it out of the park across platforms.
That's a lot of pressure to be under
but I strive under that pressure.
I have one big concept that
I've always wanted to do,
wedding dresses across the world.
What I envision is this huge runway show
that just showcases
gorgeous, expensive gowns
that women either
historically or today would be
able to wear for their wedding day.
And just have them strut the fuck out.
- Hey, Eugene.
- Hey, Andrew.
Andrew Gauthier is the Executive Producer
of Buzzfeed Motion Pictures.
So I'm excited to see how
well he takes the idea
of wedding dresses around the world.
- So what's your video this month?
- Oh, well, okay.
I really wanted to do
something with wedding gowns.
- [Andrew] How do you think
it's going to do, though?
- I think this will blow up.
- And you really think
you can do it by deadline?
- I think I can get it done in one week.
I just need--
- [Andrew] I don't believe
you're actually going
to get it done by then.
- No, I don't think I can.
I need a lot of time.
- [Andrew] I honestly
don't know about that.
- We're talking about around the world.
This needs a lot of prep time.
- [Andrew] All right, all
right, this is on you.
- Don't worry about it, I got this.
- [Andrew] Okay.
- Cool, well, enjoy your trip in London.
- [Andrew] Okay, yeah, let's
connect when I get back.
- All right.
- [Andrew] Just make it work.
- I will.
I'll fucking do it, I always do it.
Hey, hey, don't fall out the window.
Come here, come here.
I think people might associate me,
even within Buzzfeed, as someone who has
ridiculously high standards
but for me I just think
sometimes quality comes at a cost
and that cost can be people's comfort.
