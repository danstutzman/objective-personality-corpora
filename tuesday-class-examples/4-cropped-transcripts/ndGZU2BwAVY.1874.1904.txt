I've said that to like everyone I come
on is that like things that MJ we was
doing he learned from David Thompson and
Jerry those guys stuff that I've done
I've learned from MJ stuff that Brian
does learn from me and playing on the
Olympic team and we're definitely stuff
it's a chain thing man I know people
want to talk about who's this who's that
because it fills up good conversation
time or downtown whatever the case may
be before us as athletes it's really a
chain reaction you can't have one
without the other it's just not possible
that's a good point that's a good point
