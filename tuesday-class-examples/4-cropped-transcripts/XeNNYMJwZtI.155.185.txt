had to get those revenue numbers up
before their IPOs now are we talking
about the the phone itself the internet
being bad or just the social media media
element of it it's it's the social media
elephant not even the social media
element it's the engineered social media
experience that gets you to look at the
photo all the time and I try to separate
those things I mean I think the
Internet's great
I think smartphones are a miracle I
think the ability to connect with people
online is a huge innovation the thing to
get to be upset is how a small devourer
companies took that good behavior and
used it as the foundation to get us to
do this all day long
