I've never been more emotionally stressed in my life
and I think it's because so much of what is in this is wholly me.
When I say that I'm kinda bleeding this video out, it's not even a baby for me
It's literally just like slice me open and let my guts spill out.
I'm just in constant emotional pain right now.
Even rehearsal, I have to be the director, I have to be the producer.
I have to be in charge and I have to have vision
And people have to trust that I'm not gonna break down
But it's all just like stabbing my soul constantly.
Like I was always so insecure, I was never 100% confident about myself as a person
So to have to kinda trick yourself into being the most confident person as an artist
so that people believe in you and they take low-rates to come work with you
Like when I say to freak out,
When you grab something and feel the weight, I want to see it in everyone's faces.
I had to sell a vision in a way that felt like
It was worth their time.
Thank you so much!
Today when I choreographed,
I wasn't even able to choreograph myself,
because I had to figure this out.
Which is why I’m a little freaked out, because
Weirdly, almost the most important aspect of this is what I do on camera
And it is honestly the last thing I’m thinking about, because
I have to do so much off of camera
This whole week I went home and I just like-
I don’t cry, I’m not really someone who cries
Off camera: Why don’t you cry ?
Eugene: Well, I cried a lot as a little kid
All the time
My parents told me that I was always very sensitive
I could tell if someone was emotionally hurting
And I think that just always put me in a weird mood so
And I was a very depressed kid
So at age thirty-three (laughs)
