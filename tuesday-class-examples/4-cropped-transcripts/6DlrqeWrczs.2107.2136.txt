That's what your, that's what your
children want to know, that's your, what
the people you work for want to know,
that's what you want to know.
Is did, did, did you hear me?
And every argument isn't about what you
think your arguing about.
It's really about, but can you hear me?
>> Yes ma'am.
>> And many people have even said it.
>> Yes.
>> Have you not said it?
You're not hearing me.
[LAUGH].
>> Yes.
>> You're not hearing me.
So, having, having that understanding.
And I would have to say that the show, one
of the reasons why
I live such a fantastic life, is because I
pay attention.
