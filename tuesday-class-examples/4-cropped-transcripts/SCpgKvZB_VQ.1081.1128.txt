not just satisfying them, delighting them.
- Today Amazon is
employing 566,000 people.
You're probably the biggest
job creator of recent times.
At the same time,
you're aggressively criticized
by unions and by media
for paying low wages,
for inappropriate working conditions.
How do you deal with these accusations?
- Well, first of all, when any criticism,
my approach to criticism
and what I teach and preach inside Amazon
is when you're criticized,
first look in a mirror and
decide are your critics right?
If they're right, change,
don't resist.
- Are they right?
- No, not in this case
but we've had critics be right before
and we've changed.
