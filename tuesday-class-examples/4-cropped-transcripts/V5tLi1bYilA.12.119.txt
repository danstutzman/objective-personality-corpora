Hello Brains.

Just like zombieism, myths are contagious.
Passed on from person to person until everyone's infected.
I'm going to need a little help.
Luckily, while killing actually zombies requires destroying brains.
Defeating zombie myths just requires educating them.
That's why you're here Brains.
Putting these zombie ADHD myths to rest means being armed with knowledge and willing to use it.
Do you think you'd be able to recognize these myths on sight and know how to take them down?

It's complicated
Your training begins now.
1. ADHD isn't real, it's something they made up.
It's complicated.
While the name ADHD is made up and replaced older terms like
'Clumsy Child Syndrome', 'Moral Failing' and 'Minimal Brain Damage'
The actual condition has been described in medical literature for over 100 years.
In fact ADHD is one of the most well researched medical conditions.
And is now understood to be a serious neurodevelopmental disorder.
So as research continues the labels and descriptions of ADHD may change.
But it's not because it doesn't exist.
It's because we are getting better at understanding it.
2. ADHD is just a behavioral issue.
False.
While it might appear to be laziness or bad behavior.
Remember,  behavior is affected by the brain.
And the brain is affected by genetics.
ADHD is highly genetic.
According to current research here are the genetic culprits.
