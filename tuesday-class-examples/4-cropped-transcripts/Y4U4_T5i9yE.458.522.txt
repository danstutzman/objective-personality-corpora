So like for example, my brain automatically
goes to feeling unsafe and that’s just something
because of how I grew up.
I’m always looking for ways to be safe.
So I practice karate.
I’m very driven.
I have this amazing alarm system in my house
because I didn’t grow up in an environment
of safety.
So my mind is never thinking oh I’m perfectly
safe.
I don’t need to worry.
That’s just not how I’m wired after all
those years, whereas you never think anything
bad is going to happen.
So, you know, Daniel’s very comfortable
in his environment and so I can drive him
a little crazy with my fear factor.
So, while he settles me down, I can stir him
up sometimes and make him nervous.
Now fortunately he’s psychologically-minded
enough to be able to point this out and we
work on it and I have some great tools.
But you want to be aware of these things because,
you know, and I’ll often say to him, you
know you grew up in the American dream.
I grew up in the American nightmares.
So, we have to be aware of those things so
that we’re not constantly at odds and creating
chaos.
