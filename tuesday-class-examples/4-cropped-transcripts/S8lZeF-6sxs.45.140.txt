SISTERS DID NOT ACCEPT IT, AND 
WHAT DOES IT SAY TO THE GIRL WHO
IS NOT HERE THAT I ACCEPT THESE 
OFFERS, AND HOW DO WE MAKE A 
CHANGE?
>> AND THIS IS LEE DANIELS ON 
THE VERY BROADCAST LAST NIGHT 
THIS IS. 
>> WE WERE ON THE CAMPAIGN, AND 
SHE WAS MAKING UNREASONABLE 
DEMANDS, AND, YOU KNOW, AND SHE 
WASN'T THINKING, THIS IS WHEN 
REVERSE RACISM HAPPENS.
I SAID, YOU HAVE TO THANK THE 
PRODUCERS OF THE FILM AND THE 
STUDIO, AND I THINK THAT SHE 
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, AND I 
SAID, LISTEN, PEOPLE ARE NOT 
GOING TO BE RESPONDING WELL THE 
IF YOU DON'T.
I LOVE HER, AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO
HER, AND SHY IS BRILLIANT.
AND I LIKE TO WORK WITH 
BRILLIANT PEOPLE, BUT SOMETIMES,
ARTISTS GET IN THEIR OWN WAY.
I THINK THAT THERE WERE DEMAND S
THAT WERE MADE FROM HER ON THE 
"PRECIOUS" CAMPAIGN THAT 
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THAT HURT 
HER. 
>> CAN IT BE CHANGED?
>> WELL, IF SHE PLAYS BALL.
THIS IS SHOW BUSINESS, AND YOU 
HAVE TO PLAY BALL.
>> AND MONIQUE, YOU HAVE TO PLAY
BALL. 
>> AND WHEN MR. DANIELS' SAID 
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE DEMAND, AND I
WAS SCREAMING AT THE SCREEN, 
DON, ASK HIM WHAT THE DEMANDS 
WERE?
THERE WAS NO DEMANDS, AND THERE 
WAS A REQUEST FROM THE MOVIE 
STUDIO, AND THEY CALL AND 
REQUESTED THAT I FLY TO FRANCE
