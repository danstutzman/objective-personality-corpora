the good Lord every day.
- So one of the things in the book
that we kind of touched
on here, let me see
if I can find it.
I wanted to go back, I opened right to it.
The 95/5 rule, so there's two parts of it
I wanted to understand it.
So my understanding,
correct me if I'm wrong,
most people are pretty good at things.
It's this last 5% that you suck at,
it's kind of like the
weakest link in a chain.
You're only as strong as the weakest link,
and then on the next
chapter you talk about,
but focus on, you've got
to leverage your strength,
so that's another one.
So how do you balance
focusing on your weakest part,
while also, so let's say for example,
for me, I'll give an example.
I think my weakest point in the past
was I have so many kind
of ideas in my mind
that I forget to focus sometimes, right?
So maybe that's my 5%
I need to get better.
But my strength is also that I'm broad.
I reach a lot of people, so
what would be your advice
to me, like how do I balance my weakness,
but still focus on my strength?
