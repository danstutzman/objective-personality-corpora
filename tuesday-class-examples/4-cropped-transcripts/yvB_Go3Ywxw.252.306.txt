but it was too late the second time you
were homeless how did you go about
eating and showering well the second
time I was homeless was a lot easier
because I had been homeless before I had
her friend of mine this young lady lived
down the street I told her what happened
she said I'll take care of John
Jr he could stay here with me for you
know weeks JP as long as it takes you to
get another place to live no problem
I'll take care of that and then I had a
few hundred dollars in my pocket anyways
so I learned how to go to the freeway
cafe for 99 cents for breakfast go to El
Torito after 4:30 at happy hour
they just started happier they invented
happy hour where 99-cent margaritas and
it wasn't patron I assure you if I was
still a margarita for 99 cents but you
got all these little chicken wings or
tostadas or salsa with it well that was
dinner for town pretty good
Griffith Park had showers which I
remember from my youth down there where
they had the tennis courts so I went
down there - our those boys shower no
