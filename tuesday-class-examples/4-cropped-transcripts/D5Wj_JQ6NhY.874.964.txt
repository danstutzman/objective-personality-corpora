>> Well, speaking of science and
you may be bored with this
question.
But you make a distinction
between science fiction and
speculative science.
What you write you say is
speculative fiction rather.
>> You just jumped the tracks
big time.
>> [Chuckling] But what --
>> We'll get back to
what I actually believe.
I'm a hard core agnostic.
>> Okay.
>> And what does that mean?
It means you shouldn't proclaim
as knowledge something
that is actually faith.
And that's a pretty simple
distinction.
So let's just say, some
things are matters of faith
and other things are matters of
knowledge, you can prove them.
So you shouldn't confuse
the one with the other.
>> Okay. So let's move --
>> Yeah.
>> I'm glad you answered.
You had --
>> Speculative fiction, science
fiction.
The French don't have a
problem with this question.
And the reason they don't have
a problem with this question is
that they have always had a term
for what we call speculative
fiction
and it's un roman d'anticpatopm,
a novel of anticipation.
And they consider that distinct
from, different from science
fiction proper.
What would spaceships, aliens,
things taking over your body,
and you know other means of the
genre.
So they don't have a problem.
Nobody ever asks me this
question there.
They have a bit of a problem
here, I think due to the
bookstore habit
