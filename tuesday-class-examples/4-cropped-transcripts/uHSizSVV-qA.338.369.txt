have I have
many friends who love being lawyers but
if you go to law school because you
can't think of anything better to do
with yourself
and then you don't like it it's kind of
like you might have solved gone to like
engineering school and it's like maybe
it'll work out for you maybe it won't so
I think it's all about this idea of
really knowing what you want and making
a decision that's right for you not what
your fantasy self is not what other
people expect of you not what's the
easiest thing but you really say well
what do what do I want you know and
that's very uncomfortable variant like
one worse than buying a bikini looking
in the mirror loving it I bought yeah
