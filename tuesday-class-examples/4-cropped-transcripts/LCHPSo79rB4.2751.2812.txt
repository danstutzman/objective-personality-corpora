on the world?
Mel: The impact that I want to have is I want
to teach people how to discover the power
that’s inside of them.
To live fully in the open and share themselves;
who they are, who they are not like there
is so much fear that we live with.
I want to teach people how to live with more
courage because courage is nothing more than
the ability to do things that are uncertain.
In today’s world we have the internet you
can literally learn, launch, do anything.
The only thing that’s truly stopping you
are the limiting patterns that you think;
the self-doubt, the fear, the habits that
you have and you can break them.
You can break them five seconds at a time.
