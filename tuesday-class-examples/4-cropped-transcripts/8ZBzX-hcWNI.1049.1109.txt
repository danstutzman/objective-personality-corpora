Oooh! I'm coming for your kids -
which I am, actually.
- You said this quote
in one of your spoken word shows:
"Knowledge without mileage
means shit to me."
- Yeah, it equals bullshit. Yeah.
- You've travelled extensively to
some of the most far-reaching,
dangerous places in the world,
from North Korea to South Sudan
to Iraq and, uh, Afghanistan.
And these are your vacations,
if I understand correctly.
- Yeah, I travel to learn.
I've been to, like,
90 countries, all 7 continents.
Uh, my 7th was Antarctica,
which was November of last year.
It was amazing,
very moving, quite profound.
If you wanna know, you gotta go.
No book or documentary
will get you there.
When your feet are on the ground,
then you'll know Africa.
You'll understand Africa when
you land and walk out of the plane
in Kenya and go, "Oh! Oh!"
And it's the biggest "Oh!"
you'll ever say in your life.
Uh, that's how you get it.
You have to go.
A documentary about it is nice,
but it should just be
the hors d'oeuvre
that gets you in for the meal.
That is, you and a passport
and a backpack,
out into what Mark Twain
characterized as "the territory."
