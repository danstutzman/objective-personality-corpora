plan is quarterly don't write a 5-year
business plan Melanie Z asks do the
Sharks talk about failed business
pitches among themselves after the show
the Sharks are very arrogant and full of
ourselves so we really don't think of
failure we let that go pretty quickly
but all joking aside that's the hardest
thing to learn in business is that
mental fortitude to let failure just go
you know it's human nature to look at
the things we did badly and dwell on
them it's like you're on Twitter and you
get a thousand people to say nice things
about you and one person says you saw
what's the one you remember the one
person said you suck so it's the same
way we learn to let failure go you do
