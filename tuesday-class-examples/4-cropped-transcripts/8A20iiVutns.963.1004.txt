way we learn to let failure go you do
you have to as difficult as that is what
what helped you to let it go especially
when you became a public figure in those
early
ages I'm friends with Tony Robbins who I
was a big fan of and so I was at his
house about a month ago and we had this
exact discussion I said how do you do
that Tony how do you let failure go he
said I still feel like crap some days I
still feel like the world's against me I
still feel like I'm a failure some days
the biggest difference is today I give
myself three minutes
I dwell on it for three minutes and then
I snap myself out of it and I say nobody
cares stop complaining move on Nicole
