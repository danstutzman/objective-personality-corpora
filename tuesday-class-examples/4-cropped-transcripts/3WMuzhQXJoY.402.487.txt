But in my effort to avoid agreeing
with my enemy completely,
I changed from putting words
in their mouth
to acknowledging the issue
but insisting they are women's issues.
So here are two examples
of how that would go.
A men's rights activist would say to me,
"Men are far more likely
to lose their child in a custody battle."
And I would counter:
"Well, because women are unfairly
expected to be the caretaker.
It's discrimination against women
that women get custody more often."
Yes.
(Laughter)
I am not proud of that.
(Laughter)
Second example.
An MRA would say to me,
"Men are roughly 78% of all suicides
throughout the world."
And I would counter with:
"But women attempt suicide more often.
So ha!
(Laughter)
Ha?
It's not a contest.
But I kept making it into one.
Why couldn't I simply learn
about men's issues
and have compassion for male victims
without jumping at the opportunity
to insist that women are the real victims.
