Yes.
Yeah.
And I think that’s what… what happened
is it did resonate with so many, but I think
the simplicity of it was part of the appeal
and that it gives people permission to actually
make those choices because it’s not just
someone else telling them, it’s… it’s
dying people who have… who were walking
their talk.
You know, they had the regret at the end.
And… and it was so, so strong, the message.
So I think it was mostly about just the simplicity
of it and the permission to let it go for
the reader.
Yeah.
