- Here's why.
'Cause at least since Ronald Reagan,
you've had a systematic dumbing
down of the American people.
Public education delivery systems in
America could be much, much better.
My mom's whole career
in government
was trying to make Johnny
learn "gooder" at school.
She was a very frustrated person,
never got the funding she wanted.
Anyways, since at least Reagan,
we find out that
the military industrial complex
and the prison industrial complex
are multi-billion-dollar enterprises,
trillion-dollar enterprises.
So what do we need? More prisoners,
more incarcerated people.
And we need to keep battlefields
full.
And so, if you undereducate people,
they have less job skills, less options.
And they're easily arrestable,
they get high, they perpetrate.
And they're given a choice:
prison or the battlefield.
And since we have invested
in prisons and wars,
that's what we got to educate
all these young people on.
And so, back in my day, like,
when Nixon was president,
you couldn't have a guy
like Donald Trump
get an inch down the road
with the Republicans.
These are not stupid people.
They became somewhat
dumbed down 'cause they realized
they have to make racial, uh, nods
to "the black guy" in office
to get Arkansas, South Carolina -
don't get me started. But--
- Do you think that can be
a winning proposition for them?
- Yes, because they're just
trying to get small markets.
Like, I'll say those gay people
shouldn't get married.
Then I get Arkansas, Florida,
because, for some of these people,
if Bill marries Tom,
it's the end of the world.
If Bill marries Tom,
I think the day just goes on and,
you know, there's still a traffic jam
and they're still serving dinner.
So, that's an issue.
And so, back when I was young,
you couldn't have been Donald Trump
and not be laughed out of the room.
Like, you're not smart enough
to hang out with Richard Nixon.
He will kick your ass in a debate.
I'm not a fan,
but these are stupid people.
So, America's been dumbed down,
so the political message
has to be dumber.
So when you have a guy
like Barack Obama,
who did win decisively 2 times,
which shows you all is not lost,
now it's, "He's a socialist!"
You don't even know
what you're talking about!
"He wants to take my gun!"
He can't. He won't.
He's too busy trying to educate
your kid to take your gun.
And so...
(crowd laughing)
And so the political climate now is,
who can outshout the other person.
And it's embarrassing,
it's humiliating,
but it's on target for
a consumerist society that obviously
is not interested in equality,
not interested that much
in civil rights
or interested in what you see now.
Americans can choose whatever
they want - we're largely in charge.
We can make schools better.
All you need to take is, like,
2 drops of funding from the military.
Like, they won't even notice it.
Like, one less space laser.
And you can put a laptop or an iPad
on every desk
in every public school in America.
And, trust me,
the prisons will empty,
the crime will go down,
the humour will be better.
Women will get treated better,
kids will get treated better.
Less domestic violence - everything
gets better with education.
America could do that right now and,
in 50 years,
it could be cleaner, better, safer, 
"gooder," funnier, sexier.
We're obviously not interested.
I am! But we are not.
