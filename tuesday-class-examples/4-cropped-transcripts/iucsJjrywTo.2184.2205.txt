what he's always it's amazing I don't
know pretty balloon say bye
are there any annoying aspects to Joel
that we should be aware of I know
there's time closed doors
what annoys you about it I probably way
more spontaneous than he is I just want
to do different things try different
food do and he's pretty routine he likes
to do the same thing all the time he's
comfortable in his routine and so those
are things that we kind of you know
