I live such a fantastic life, is because I
pay attention.
I pay attention to my life.
And your life is your greatest teacher.
Every single thing that's happening to you
every day.
Your, your joys, your, your, your
sadnesses, your challenges, your worries,
your, everything is happening to bring you
closer to in here.
Everything is trying to take you home to
yourself.
