the best advice I ever got was a reverse
advice which was someone who said I
wouldn't succeed right and that's not it
was the best for me I should say and
that was my boyfriend a slash business
partner who left me to marry my
secretary after I was in business with
him living with him for seven years and
he told me on the way out the door ex I
left finally when I had the courage and
started my own business all over again
and he said I'd never succeed without
him let me tell you the best advice an
insult I think I use that insult to
build the rest of my career on the back
of that insult and I fueled me when I
couldn't find fuel in other places so be
care be careful women are vindictive I
got even I'm not successful the first
