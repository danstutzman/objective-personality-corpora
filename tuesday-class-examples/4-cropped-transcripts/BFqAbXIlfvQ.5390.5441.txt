do we go from here and right now I feel
like we need to keep abortion illegal
but do our best to limit and prevent
that situation from happening and I do
think some factors that are affecting
the abortions that do happen are and I'm
gonna sound so traditional and less
straight-laced here but I do think from
askew 'ti is you know it really has gone
through the roof
yeah unchecked and without borders and
and so you know that that increases risk
also women getting married later in life
so basically having more years that they
are single and dating and therefore then
because I think once you're with the
person that you want to be with for the
rest of your life you wouldn't
immediately jump to an abortion if it
was unplanned you're if you did want
