didn't like that that I was not but I
was in present but when he came to see
me and we talked about Kmart he just he
just didn't he didn't understand the
value of my brand at that fantastic
store I loved Kmart because the product
I made their design for them and they
created for me was some of the best
product I've ever made because it was so
beautifully done and sorry and such
value I still have all the sheets and
comforters on my bids and a big mansion
up in Maine and it's a Ford's house came
right huntin still from Kmart and all
the towels there so they were so
fabulous that they're still fabulous so
and the garden tools everything was so
good but he didn't he didn't get it he
didn't get that he didn't get about
merchandising and I'm a good merchant so
