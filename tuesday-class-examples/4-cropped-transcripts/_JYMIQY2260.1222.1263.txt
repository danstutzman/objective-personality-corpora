- This is a very big moment.
- [Voiceover] Anonymous wants
to know, "How do you deal with
"bullying in the
workplace or in life?"
- Bullying in the work place?
If you're an adult this
should absolutely not allowed.
I mean leave.
Call to HR.
- Period.
- Just create a stink.
You're not five.
If you have a job you are
responsible for what is
happening in your environment 
and for what you allow.
One of my sayings is that
you allow, promote or create
everything that happens to you.
So if you put up with
bullying that's just completely
unacceptable and thank you for
asking the question I hope you
just take action immediately.
