tweet call it chatter so yeah something
anyone else okay final question for you
is what is your definition of greatness
I think greatness is living a life
that's not so self-centered and going
through life with the understanding that
you are your brother's keeper and you do
have an obligation to help when and
where you can and you should go out of
your way to do that if you if you can
just do those things you're great mmm
thank you so much for sure how's my
