You guys know that
while I was editing this
I thought I had cleavage.
Oh, there she goes.
Huh?
Oh, that's when I started
getting my wrinkles.
Mhmm.
Oh, drinking the wine.
Look at that haircut.
I, guys, can I tell you the
story behind this haircut?
I gotta pause it right there.
Right before the opening credits.
That haircut right there that
we're looking at together?
Oh god.
That was my cool New York haircut.
That was a haircut
I went to a special
barbershop in Williamsburg
and asked them to do to my head.
It was the first time I
cut my hair that short.
Oh wow.
