on to become huge stars stars and I
always look at it that way you know what
I think what I give them
stands them in very good stead when they
go on they'll always tell me that you
know they they look at roles differently
roles that they're offered they they
often call me when they're you know if
the young actors who are still
auditioning for things and who aren't
big stars yet you know they'll call me
and say skipper how should I should I do
this and how should I do that and you
know I try to provide some information
if I can if I've got the context and and
those things lead me to believe that
what I've been able to do with them is
valuable mmm that's cool that's really
