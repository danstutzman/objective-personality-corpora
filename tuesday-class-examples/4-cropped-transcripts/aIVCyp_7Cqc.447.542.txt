When you go out in the field, you remember
parts of it.
You knock on doors, you're not quite sure
of yourself.
A lot of doors are closed in your face, but
what happens, after a while you start getting
used to it and you see what you can say or
do that'll make it better.
When you go back the next day with your other
salespeople, what did you see, what did you
do, what did I say?
Let's say I knock on a hundred doors to get
into one, give 10 presentations to sell one
book.
Then, when you get better and better at it
through your experiences and losses along
the way, it sharpens you up, where all of
a sudden I got to a point where if I gave
three presentations, I have no less than one
order commission-only.
I believed that I could do that.
I believed that Collier's was the best set
of books because a high school student could
read it.
It wasn’t like a college manual you had
to read.
I was doing something good for somebody.
You have to believe that what you're doing
is good, it's going to benefit somebody, and
you learn as you go.
Okay, do I look someone in the eye?
See, a lot of people don’t know these things.
Look someone in the eye.
All too often, people say, "It's hard to look
someone in the eye, because you feel uncomfortable."
Of course you do.
They're not on the same wavelength you're
on or the same frequency.
What do you do?
How do you overcome that?
You learn these things along the way.
You look them right between the eyes or at
their eyebrow.
Looks like you're looking them in the eye.
I've been working on a book for a couple of
years with some of these tips.
It's not ready yet.
Maybe next year it'll be ready.
Tom Bilyeu: Oh, man.
John Paul D.: There's all these things, and,
of course, smile.
Smile is the most wonderful thing God gave
us.
You don’t smile when you first talk to somebody.
You smile before you knock on their door.
If your day sucks, you fake it, "Hi, how you
doing?"
Because when you smile, everything changes.
Things will change.
