Just a quick question.
What the (bleep) is wrong
with you?
I mean, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
Love what I'm doing.
Okay, so why are you carrying
around your own poop in a jar?
I did, uh, have a beaker
of human feces
when I was explaining
why we need a reinvented toilet.
You don't need to reinvent
a toilet.
We shit in it,
then we push a button,
then the shit disappears.
It's perfect.
Well, toilets are something
we take for granted,
but billions of people
don't have them.
Even in these growing cities
in poor countries,
 they can't afford
 to build sewers,
 and that causes diseases.
And so we have to come up
with a very different way
of taking care of that waste.
CHIENG: And because so much
 of the world
 lacks a sanitary place to poo,
 Bill launched
 the Reinvent the Toilet
 Challenge.
 It funds scientists
 to redesign toilets
 that don't need a sewer system.
We put several hundred million
into this
-to show that it can be done.
-Wait, sorry, hang on.
You put several hundred million
dollars into toilets.
Giving it away, you bet.
CHIENG:
 Oh, my God. Is Bill Gates
 literally flushing his fortune
 down the toilet?
 To find out, I flew all the way
 to University of South Florida,
