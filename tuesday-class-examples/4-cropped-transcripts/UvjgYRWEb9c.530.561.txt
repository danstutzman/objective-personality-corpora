- You can take the smartest guy there is
or woman from your best university,
Princeton, Harvard,
Stanford, and I don't care
how smart they are, okay,
they don't have two things.
They don't have experience
and they don't have history
and I'll outdo them
every time on experience
and history and I don't
care how smart kids think
they are today, they
really are, and they're
probably smarter than us at that stage,
but they don't have
history and they don't have
experience, and you can
never make up for that.
I don't care how smart you are.
