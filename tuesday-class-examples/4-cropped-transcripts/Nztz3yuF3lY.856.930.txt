not knowing what's happening
in the world.
So how do you then...
you know, relate to each other?
-Because one thing that...
-We don't talk about politics.
That's interesting. That's
actually what I wanted to know,
because you have...
you have nine people
who have
different political leanings,
who are all extremely skilled
when it comes to applying law,
and oftentimes, you have
to argue against each other.
So when you're having lunch
with each other,
when you're just, you know,
in that down time,
what do you talk about?
No politics.
We stay away from religion
and politics,
-Ah. -the two subjects
that most people who,
if they don't want to fight,
should stay away from.
-Ah.
-Um, and we do.
So, what do we talk about?
What bad movie did we see
yesterday?
(laughter)
-Sometimes what good movie.
-Okay.
What books we're reading.
And most of my colleagues--
myself included--
love history books.
And so all of us
are generally reading something
that we find fun and will
recommend to the others.
-Interesting.
-We talk about kids,
lots of talks...
talk about grandchildren.
Uh, sometimes about food.
Um, any topic that any group
of friends would have
that doesn't involve
a contentious issue,
-we talk about.
-Okay. Okay.
