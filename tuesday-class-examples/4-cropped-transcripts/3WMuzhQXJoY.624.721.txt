So in October 2016,
the film was released in theaters,
and articles and critic reviews
started to roll in.
And that's when I experienced
how engaged the media is
in group think around gender politics.
And I learned a difficult lesson.
When you start to humanize your enemy,
you, in turn, may be dehumanized
by your community.
And that's what happened to me.
Rather than debating the merit
of the issues addressed in the film,
I became the target of a smear campaign,
and people who had never seen the movie
protested outside the theater doors,
chanting that it was harmful to women.
It certainly is not.
But I understand their mindset.
If I never made this movie,
and I heard that there was
a documentary screening
about men's rights activists
that didn't show them as monsters,
I too would have protested the screenings
or at least sign the petitions
to ban the film
because I was told
that they were my enemy.
I was told that men's rights activists
were against women's equality.
But all the men's rights activists I met
support women's rights
and are simply asking the question:
"Why doesn't our society
care about men's rights?"
