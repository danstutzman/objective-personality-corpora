WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.
AS I SAID BEFORE THE BREAK, I'M
TRYING TO GET YOU TO SAY
SOMETHING NICE ABOUT DONALD
TRUMP.
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR NINE
MONTHS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT NOW.
IS THERE SOMETHING NICE YOU
COULD SAY ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP?
>> UH...
( LAUGHTER )
>> Stephen: WOULD YOU LAKE ME
TO GO FIRST?
>> YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST?
>> Stephen: HE STILL HAS ALL
HIS TEETH --
( LAUGHTER )
-- OR SOMEONE'S TEETH.
HE HAS SOMEONE'S TEETH.
ANYTHING?
>> YEAH, I MEAN --
( LAUGHTER )
UH --
>> Stephen: I WANT TO WARN OUR
AFFILIATES, WE MIGHT BE GOING
LONG.
( PIANO RIFF )
( LAUGHTER )
>> WELL, LET'S SAY THIS, HE HAS
TALK ABOUT TAKING ON THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND
LOWERING THE VERY, VERY HIGH
COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN
THIS COUNTRY, AND HE IS RIGHT TO
MAKE THE POINT THAT THE DRUG
COMPANIES ARE RIPPING US OFF IN
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WAY.
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN,
LET'S GO FORWARD TOGETHER AND DO
THAT.
>> Stephen: HE ALSO AGREES
WITH YOU ON INFRASTRUCTURE.
