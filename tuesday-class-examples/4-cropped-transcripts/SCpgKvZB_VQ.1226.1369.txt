and we responded to that.
On the issue of working conditions,
I'm very proud of our working conditions
and I'm very proud of
the wages that we pay.
In Germany, we employ 16,000 people,
we pay at the high end of the range
for any comparable work.
- Will the union fight
because the union want to make
sure that you are unionized
or what is the real
substance of the conflict?
- Well, it's a good question
and this is in my longer version
of how to deal with critics,
there are two kinds of critics,
there are well meaning critics who,
they're worried it's not gonna work
but they do want it to work
so I could give you an
example of customer reviews
would be one of those.
When we first did customer
reviews 20 years ago,
some book publishers
were not happy about it
because some of them were negative
and so it was a very controversial
practice at that time
but we thought it was right
and so we stuck to our guns
and had a deep keel on that
and didn't change.
But there's a second kind of critic
which is the self interested critic
and they come in all shapes and sizes.
So they can be any kind of institution,
competitors, of course,
and so when you are doing
something in a new way
and if customers embrace the new way,
what's gonna happen is incumbents
who are practicing the older way
are not gonna like you
and they're gonna be
self interested critics.
And so you do need as you're
looking yourself in the mirror
to try and tease those two things apart.
In our view, we have
workers counsels of course
and we have very good
communications with our employees.
So we don't believe that we need a union
to be an intermediary
between us and our employees
but of course at the end of the day,
it's always the employees choice
and that's how it should be.
But for sure, we would be very naive
to believe that we're
not gonna be criticized.
That's just part of the terrain,
you have to accept that.
One other thing I tell people
is if you're gonna do
anything new or innovative,
you have to be willing
to be misunderstood.
If you can't afford to be misunderstood,
then for goodness sake,
don't do anything new or innovative.
