and the part that he's leaving out his
brother told me back in the dressing
room that after they caught the guy
who's going you know what people work
really hard for their stuff and and you
stole it and you shouldn't do that you
should choose a different path than life
he's over there
bridge into the gap what if that was
your sister and you just broke her car
windows like would you like him someone
do that to you without Greg Jax is like
you puto money calling like all these
