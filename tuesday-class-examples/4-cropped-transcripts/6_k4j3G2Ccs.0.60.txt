Somebody needs to sit down every human
being by the time they hit maybe 11 or 12
and tell them: life is not going to go by plan
It's just not, something is going to
happen that puts a big chink in the chain
you're going to fail as a matter of fact
you're going to fail more than you
succeed, you're going to get your dream
you're going to be disillusioned by your dreams
you may get your dream and it may
be a lot of things in your dream like me
I've gotten everything that I dreamed
about but there's lots of disillusionment
there's been a lot of failures along the
way there's been a lot of pain along the way
the loss of my parent, the taking
care of that loss, the burying my father
Relationships gone awry
and I think that life ultimately is about
it's about the journey and it's
about having the tools in order to
navigate your way through those failures
in order to get to any level of joy and
appreciation of your life
