I'm not blowing smoke up your ass, you are
fricking Liz Gilbert.
Your writing is impeccable and I just felt
instantly pulled into this time machine, and
it was so glorious.
And so I was thinking to myself, "Goodness,
does Liz know all this stuff about this time
period?
Or was this, 'Oh, wow, I have this idea, I
want to envelop this world, but I also need
to do a shit ton of research?'"
Shit ton of research.
Okay.
Yeah.
Like four years of research.
Wow.
And which-
What does that look like?
Well, it's like everything finding a historian
to walk me around Times Square and show me
some existing theaters, but more importantly,
to kind of have... paint a word picture so
he could show me what it used to look like.
So, we could stand there and we're right in
front of a Nike store, but he's telling me
about the theater that used to be in that
place.
And it was also reading a ton of novels that
were written in the 1930s and '40s to get
the tone of the way that people spoke.
Interviews with former showgirls and actresses
and dancers in their nineties about their
professional lives and their sex lives, which
they were more than happy to talk to me about,
which was great.
And just an immersion, an absolute immersion.
It's almost like learning a second language,
learning another time and another place is
like learning a new language.
So that by the time you write it, you can
write it convincingly.
Really?
