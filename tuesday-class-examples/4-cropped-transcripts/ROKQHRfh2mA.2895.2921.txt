Cal Newport comm nice and simple yeah
all right what is the impact that you
want to have on the world I think I want
to help people live deeper more
meaningful lives and I want to do so
from the perspective of figuring out how
to put all this technological miracles
that computer scientists like me helped
invent how to put them to work for you
and prevent them from just getting in
your way from reaching that state of
eudaimonia I love that all right guys
