The only thing that exists right now is this
current moment; the present moment of now.
The trick to getting yourself back on track
is to become a master at living in the moment
because the truth is you are capable of handling
anything that happens in this current moment
of now.
I call this practice "making is-ness your
business."
in fact, I wrote a whole chapter on it in
my book Making Every Man Want You.
Making is-ness your business means giving
your full attention and focus to this moment,
whatever is happening right now.
You've got to ask yourself: can I handle what's
actually happening in this moment of now?
Not your drama filled thoughts about what's
happening, but the reality of what's happening
in this moment.
For example, is your heart beating right now?
Yes.
Perfect.
Are you breathing right now?
Yes.
Awesome.
Then you've handled this moment.
Now that moment is over and you're in a new
moment.
Play this game long enough and you'll condition
yourself to be engaged in your real life instead
of your thoughts about your life.
