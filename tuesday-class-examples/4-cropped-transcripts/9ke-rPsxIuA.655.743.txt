There’s…
I can’t count how many decisions I’ve
made based on this and how many small and
large crossroads.
But if I’m faced with a decision that takes
a lot of courage and I find that courage now
because I think, “Ok, I can go this way,
it might be the easy way, or I can go this
way.
It feels harder, scarier or whatever, but
this is actually where I want to go.”
And I think, “I’m either gonna regret
this or I’m not, you know, which… which
way causes no regrets?”
The hard way, the challenging way, face the
courage way.
And so you do become more and more courageous,
you know, as you start using this as a tool
for living, you know, using the wisdom from
the dying as a tool for living.
And so many decisions I make, even small decisions
now, ultimately they’re affected, they’ve
been shaped by these regrets.
Because if it’s not going to feel good for
me, I don't do it anymore.
I just…
I say no to way more than I say yes to.
I…
I love yes, don't worry.
I, you know, I love the word yes, but I’ve
learned to comfortably say no to so many things
without guilt, without explanation, just because
I know there’s other things that will feel
better for me and that no one’s really at
a loss if I say no.
It doesn't matter, you know, we have to follow
our own heart’s calling and that heart’s
calling ends up benefiting everyone in the
long run anyway.
