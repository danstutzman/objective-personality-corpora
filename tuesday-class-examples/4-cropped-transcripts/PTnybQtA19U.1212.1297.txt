ANNA KENDRICK: My
friend, Ben Platt--
AUDIENCE: Whoo.
ANNA KENDRICK: Oh, that was the
biggest name drop of the night.
I think he said it best
in his Tony speech.
He said, what
makes you different
is what makes you powerful.
And I was like that
thing, yes, what he said.
So yeah, it's--
I think finding your tribe is
important, whatever that means.
And I always hate that--
I hate that thing
of like when adults
are like, oh, none of this
will matter in the real world.
Because if you're in it,
it sucks for you now.
If somebody asked me to suffer
through four years of feeling
targeted and ostracized,
I would be like,
I really don't want to do that.
And you telling me that it
will be over in four years
doesn't make it better.
So I think just trying
to like find strength
in yourself if you
feel misunderstood
and knowing that
you are powerful,
and the things that make
you odd and the things
that people don't understand
are the things that give you
value in the world, I think.
I'm just paraphrasing
what he said.
He said it better.
