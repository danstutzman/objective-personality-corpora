Yeah.
I’m curious, when you were actually hearing
those regrets, as you’re a sensitive soul,
you’re a creative soul, was it hard emotionally
to be there and stand there and care for these
people at the same time have so much emotion
that you’re absorbing and listening to?
The… the level of anguish and frustration
that the dying people shared, expressed while
they were sharing these regrets, was impossible
not to be affected by.
But I also had to trust that that was their
life path and at least they were learning
those things at the end.
And some of them made me promise that I would
share their wisdom on so that people would
learn from their mistakes.
So if anything I just felt very honored and…
and grateful to be that messenger and to also
have the lesson given to me repeatedly so
that I was actually incorporating it into
my own life.
I couldn’t teach it without walking it myself,
so if anything it was… as heartbreaking
as it often was for me, there were plenty
of tears in the bathroom with the door closed
during those years, but as difficult as that
was it was also far more an honor than anything
to work in that role.
