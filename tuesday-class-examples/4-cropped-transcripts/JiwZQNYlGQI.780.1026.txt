This YouTube career I'd stumbled into
was all of those things.
At 32, I was divorced, miserable,
and had no idea
what I was doing with my life.
At 33, I'd started my own business,
and was connecting with ADHD experts.
By now, at 34,
I have a team of volunteers
helping with the channel.
I'm engaged to this amazing man
who helps me produce the channel,
works right alongside with me,
is doing the slides right now -
and, as we discovered, also has ADHD.
(Laughter)
I'm working on reaching out to schools
so that kids don't have
to wait until they're 32
to learn about their brains.
And I'm doing my very first TEDx talk
here with you today.
(Cheers) (Applause)
But wait! There's more! Wait.
(Applause)
That did sound like the end
of the speech. I'm sorry, it's not.
(Laughter)
I'm happier and more successful
than I've ever been in my life.
So, what happened?
How did I reach my potential?
Three things: one, I learned
about my brain, my ADHD brain,
both on my own and by connecting
with others who have it.
If you judge a fish
by its ability to climb a tree,
it will live its whole life
believing it is stupid,
unless it happens to chat 
with another fish
and realizes fish aren't great
at climbing trees, and that's okay,
there's plenty of ocean.
Two, in learning about my brain,
I found and stumbled
into a job that engages it.
If you spend all your time trying
to get a fish to able to climb a tree,
you'll never see how far it can swim.
It turns out I can be me
and still be successful.
I just had to find my ocean.
Three, I learned strategies
for challenges I still face.
I have no fish analogy
for this one, I'm sorry.
(Laughter)
I guess I learned how to swim.
Once you know what
your brain's challenges are,
you can find solutions to them.
Once you look past the stereotypes
and assumptions about people with ADHD,
and dig deeper, you learn
what ADHD actually is.
It's not people who won't stop fidgeting,
or getting distracted.
It is brains that are
chronically underaroused,
trying to get the basic level
of stimulation all brains need.
It's not about procrastinating
or not caring.
It's having executive function deficits
that make it hard to get started.
And it's not people being lazy
or not trying enough.
It's kids and adults struggling to succeed
with a brain that doesn't always
want to cooperate
in a society that wasn't built for them.
Society is our user's manual.
We learn how our brains and bodies work
by watching those around us.
And, when yours works differently,
it can feel like you're broken.
So, what I'm trying to do
is reach out to these people
wherever they are
in the world, and tell them,
"You are not weird. You are not stupid.
You do not need to try harder.
You are not a failed version of normal.
You are different, you are beautiful,
and you are not alone."
If you don't ADHD yourself, chances are
you know somebody who does.
They're your employee, your boss,
your friend, they're in this room.
I hope this talk helps you
understand them better.
If you do have ADHD,
welcome to the tribe.
(Applause) (Cheers)
