Ya know?
I am an insecure, a little bit angry,
very judgmental person, and
I've admitted it to myself
and I gotta work on that shit.
I gotta work on it and
I am working on it now.
And one of the ways I'm working on it
is surrounding myself
with people that say yes.
Because if I'm saying
an idea, and I'm hearing
negativity, negativity,
and doubt and doubt,
and fear and fear, trust me, I got plenty
of negativity and doubt and fear.
I got oodles of it.
I got so much paranoia, so much looking
for the other shoe to drop.
I got that.
All I need from the people
that I surround myself with
is faith and trust and
love and just say yes.
