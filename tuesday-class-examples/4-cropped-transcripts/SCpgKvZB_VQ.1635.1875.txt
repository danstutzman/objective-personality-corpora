"Yes, it's fine."
- The whole attitude towards
data protection and privacy
has always been different
between Europe and the United States
but is also at the moment
in the context of Cambridge Analytica
changing in the United States.
What are the consequences
for a company like Amazon?
- My view on this for Amazon--
- Is it hysterical or
is it inappropriate--
- Honestly, I think this
is one of the great questions of our age.
I think of the internet,
so the internet is this big
new powerful technology,
it's horizontal, it affects every industry
and then if you think of
even more broadly tech
and machine learning and big data
and all these kinds of things,
these are big horizontal
powerful technologies
and in my view, so we've been at scale.
The internet is quite old at this point,
it's been around a long time
but at scale, it's really only
been around 10 or 15 years,
'cause go back in time
20 years, it was tiny.
And so at scale, the
internet's been around
only 10 or 15 years
and we haven't learned as a civilization,
as a human species,
we haven't learned how to operate it yet.
So we're still,
we as a civilization
are still figuring that out.
And so it has fantastic,
gives us fantastic capabilities.
The fact that I can look up
almost anything on Wikipedia
in five seconds
is an unbelievable capability
that just simply didn't exist 20 years ago
and so on and so on and so on,
there's so many good things
but we're also finding out
that these powerful tools
enable some very bad things too
like letting authoritarian governments
interfere in free democratic
elections around the world.
It's incredibly scary thing.
- So you're advocating a balance
of let's say entrepreneurs
who are really moving
their businesses forward,
politicians and regulators
who are finding a certain framework,
a society, journalists who are
asking unpleasant questions?
- So my view on Amazon's role in this
which is what you asked me
is I think first of all,
we have a duty on behalf of society
to try and help educate any regulators,
give them our point of
view on this sincerely
without any cynicism or skepticism,
this is what we believe,
but it's not ultimately our decision.
So we will work
with any set of regulations
that we're given.
Ultimately society decides that,
we will follow those rules
regardless of the impact
they have on our business
and we will find a new way if
need be to delight customers.
So we will always be,
again, some of these things,
what you have to worry about
is the problem, what I
would not want to see happen
is that you don't want to
block invention and innovation.
So that's always one of the things,
one of the unintended
consequences often of regulation
is that it really favors the incumbents.
Now Amazon at this point is an incumbent
so maybe I should be happy about that
but I wouldn't be
because I think for society
you really want to see continued progress.
So to the degree that we have regulation,
you want to be sure that
it is incenting innovation
and not blocking it
while at the same time protecting.
But data security, privacy, encryption,
how do you safeguard
people's physical safety
against terrorists and bad
actors all over the world
and how do you balance
that against privacy?
These are very challenging questions.
