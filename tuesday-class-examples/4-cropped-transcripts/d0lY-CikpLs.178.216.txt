gather that evidence gather the facts so
that that can be presented right so I
guess one of the differences between the
early Iraq war and now is that there
seems to be very little dissent on the
left or at least among mainstream
liberals they all seem for this all the
big media outlets all the pundit Rhianna
television suggests support for Donald
Trump from the left have you noticed
that and what accounts for that do you
think I don't guess to know where people
are coming from or why but I really wish
personally as a veteran that especially
people in positions of power whether
they be in the media or in Congress in
Washington to be very careful in
understanding exactly what the cost of
these wars are and what the consequences
