>> Well, speaking of religion.
Religion is a part of
so many of your books
and you have read and reread the
Bible.
So I'm kind of curious to know
what your beliefs are and what
you get?
My guess is you get lots
of fodder for your stories.
>> From the Bible -- well
there are three big wellsprings
of motifs in Western literature.
Greek and Roman liturgy and
mythology is one of them.
Folk tale, you know, Grimm's
fairytale.
We all know who Cinderella is.
In fact, Cinderella happens
to be the oldest story
that we know about in the world.
And those glass slippers used to
be furs, isn't that interesting?
>> It is.
>> So folk tale, Greek and
Roman mythology, and the Bible.
And if you went through honors
English which was from
Anglo-Saxon to T.S. Eliot
in the early, late '50s, early
'60s where I went to university.
You had to know the Bible.
