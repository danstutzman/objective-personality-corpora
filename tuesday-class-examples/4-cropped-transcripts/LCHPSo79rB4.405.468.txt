everything.
Tom: That core concept comes through so powerfully
in your book which is phenomenal and I would
love it if you would take a second to tell
people the story of how, and by the way I
wore the NASA shirt because of the imagery.
Mel: Oh is that why you wore it?
Tom: Of course.
Mel: Oh my God I’ve like falling my glasses
off that is, I did not even get that.
I was going to ask you why you wore that shirt
oh my gosh, wow.
Tom: Break it down.
Mel: You actually do your homework.
Tom: Of course Mel absolutely.
Mel: Let me just take you back, so what you
are talking about is the five second rule
which has become literally my life’s work
and it was all a gigantic mistake.
I read up on you too and understand how quest
like was born out of misery.
The five second rule and my life now and my
20 year marriage and everything that I’m
doing and the companies that I’ve built
and sold and the company I’m building now,
it all comes back to a point in my life that
completely and utterly blew.
