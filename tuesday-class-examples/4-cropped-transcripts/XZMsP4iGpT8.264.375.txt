And then, I don't
have coffee again.
We're sitting
there, and I thought
it was just the
title of the show,
Comedians In Cars Having Coffee.
Oh, my God.
The amount of coffee you
drink is not good for you.
Yeah, no.
It wasn't good.
You really do drink
the entire time.
The whole time.
I just started drinking coffee.
When?
Just a few years ago.
I never drank it my
entire adult life.
Until this series?
Is that why--
Just before the series.
I drank this drink.
And I go, this is
a fantastic drink.
And it really gets you chatty.
[LAUGHTER]
So I felt, why don't I do a show
with comedians drinking coffee,
getting chatty?
Yeah.
And that's how I
started doing it.
But when they come
over with the pot,
don't you think it's
nice that they go,
would you like some more coffee?
They don't say, would
you like more pasta?
Would you like more steak?
They say, would you
like more coffee?
So whenever the guy comes
over, I would say, sure.
It seems nice.
He never stopped
drinking coffee.
And we were there hours.
Yeah, hours.
And you never peed.
You never got up.
[LAUGHTER]
And you sleep at night?
Yes.
Yeah, it doesn't
bother me, really.
I was having one right before.
That's crazy.
I love coffee, now.
Just black, right?
No, I add a little
half and half.
OK.
Or black, I don't care.
I love any kind of coffee.
Wow.
Why did it take you so long?
Why so late in life?
I didn't know about it.
You know how comedians
can be very out of it,
in certain ways?
No.
OK.
What do you mean comedians
can be out of it?
Coffee has been everywhere,
all over the world, forever.
Like, you've never--
You know a lot of
comedians that have
major chunks of
dysfunction or ignorance
about giant things of life.
They just don't know.
Coffee is not a giant thing.
Coffee is--
I just missed it.
I missed it.
I didn't know that it was great.
It's great.
It is.
It's a great drink.
