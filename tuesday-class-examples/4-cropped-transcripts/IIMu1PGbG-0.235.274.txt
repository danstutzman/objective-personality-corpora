is a bad strategy for achieving that
goal there's a couple reasons I believe
this first follow your passion
presupposes that you have a pre-existing
passion that you can identify and follow
we actually don't have a lot of evidence
that this is true for most people in
fact one study I wrote about had a
psychologist take a large group of
seniors this is at a Canadian university
a large group of seniors and they
subjected them to all of these
questionnaires to try to figure out what
if anything they were passionate about
when I went back and went through the
data and even being very generous in my
accounting it was less than 5% of these
students that actually had a passion
that was even remotely relevant to a
career choice probably guess the number
