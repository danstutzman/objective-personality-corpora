>> I DO HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL  
YOU.                            
>> OH.                          
>> OH, MY.                      
>> WOW.                         
>> OH, MY GOD.                  
>> TALK TO US.                  
>> THAT LITTLE GIRL, HALEY JOY, 
I'M CRYING.                     
>> SHE'S CRYING.                
>> IS MY DAUGHTER.              
I ADOPTED HER.                  
>> YOU THINK THAT BY A CERTAIN  
STAGE IN YOUR LIFE, I'VE HAD    
EVERY EXPERIENCE I'M GOING TO   
HAVE.                           
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE  
SHOWS UP.                       
I FELT LIKE, IN MY LIFE, I'VE   
HAD JOY BEYOND WHAT I COULD HAVE
IMAGINED.                       
BUT THIS IS BEYOND A DREAM, LIKE
YOU HAVE YOUR DREAMS, AND THEN  
THIS.                           
I NEVER BELIEVED IN LOVE AT     
FIRST SIGHT, UNTIL NOW.         
SHE PROBABLY THINKS IT'S RAINING
IN HER NURSERY BECAUSE I'M      
ALWAYS LOOKING AT HER AND CRYING
ON HER.                         
SHE MUST BE LIKE WHAT IS        
HAPPENING IN HERE?              
BUT I THINK THAT SHE'S THE      
PUZZLE PIECE.                   
WHEN THEY FIRST HANDED ME HALEY,
I WAS SCARED TO HOLD HER.       
AND THE MINUTE SHE WAS IN MY    
ARMS, IT WAS A PERFECT FIT.     
I ALWAYS HAD A FEELING INSIDE   
THAT I WANTED A BABY, BUT I     
THOUGHT IT WAS TOO LATE.        
I WAS DIVORCED.                 
AND I HAD CANCER.               
YOU THINK, OKAY.                
I DON'T GET EVERYTHING AND IT'S 
OKAY.                           
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU   
LOOK AROUND AND GO, WHY NOT ME? 
AND IT JUST KEPT GNAWING AT ME. 
AND ONE DAY, I SAID TO JOEL, I  
WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.      
AND I SAID, AND THIS IS A BIG   
DEAL, I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT 
IT.                             
I DON'T WANT YOU TO ANSWER RIGHT
AWAY.                           
I SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE 
ADOPTION WITH YOU.              
AND HE SAID, I DON'T NEED A     
MINUTE.                         
I'M IN.                         
WHEN I LOOK AT HER, LIKE I      
SEE -- FOREVER, I SEE PAST ME,  
PAST -- I SEE, LIKE THE FUTURE, 
WHICH I GUESS I NEVER SAW.      
I WANT HER TO KNOW THAT SHE IS  
LOVED BY ME, BY FAMILY.         
AND BY EVERYONE WHO HAS HELD
