Jeff, John mentioned,
it's the last question,
John mentioned that you
are an ideal family man,
your kids are extremely important,
you just mentioned that
when we spoke earlier.
If we would talk to your kids,
where would they criticize their dad?
- They would make fun of my singing.
- Okay, can we get a?
- No, God no.
They would make fun of my inability
to remember exact words.
I'm always quoting Churchill or something
and getting it wrong
and they're like, "That's not even close
"to what Churchill said."
