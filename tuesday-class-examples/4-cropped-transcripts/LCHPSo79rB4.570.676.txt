way too long that was a trick your brain played
on you.
By the time that they closed the second restaurant
it was an $800,000 loss.
Tom: Whoa.
Mel: I mean that meant our entire home equity
line gone.
It meant kid’s college, I just choked just
thinking about how terrifying it was.
I found myself at the age of 41 like just
feeling like a complete failure and so did
Chris.
To make it worse not only had we lost all
of our savings, but so many friends and family
members had invested so there was this real
tension between the truth of what was happening
and what you had to do in public because it
was public business; shame, failure, embarrassment
and the lien started to hit the house.
The phone started to ring and it was nothing
but collection calls.
I just remember feeling this tremendous shame
and at some point I think we all hit that
moment in life where things just are not going
how you thought they would go.
What’s amazing about those moments is we
all respond very differently.
My husband he would spring out of bed and
he would head right out that door six o’clock
in the morning and he would go meet his partner
and they would go to the bank and they would
dig right in and they would face their problems
head on.
He is also a smart guy I mean he did not want
to be in the house when yours truly woke up
because I was a raging bitch at that point
in our lives.
The reason why is because when you are scared
and you are afraid and you are jealous and
you are overwhelmed with emotions, it is so
much easier to point the finger at other people.
That’s a decision by the way one you may
not be aware that you are making but you are
still making it.
