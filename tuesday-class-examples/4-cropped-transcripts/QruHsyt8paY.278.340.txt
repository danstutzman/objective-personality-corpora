Always like a 100 times better than what I thought it was.
This is actually like getting into a warm bed. It's like I'm returning home.
I have always thrived off of design, cinematography, and dance and movement and the emotional interpretation of an idea.
This really is the, I guess, exact polar opposite of a vlog.
For me that is like returning home.
This video is really more like how Eugene is as an artist.
And I hope I can come back home like this more often.
Kane: What are you most afraid of or nervous about?
Eugene: I'm always nervous that when I attempt to do more traditional cinematic projects like this online
that the audience might reject it.
It'll be difficult to see if the reasons I was withholding was because I was right about my fears.
About who might not accept me anymore.
I think I actually like doing these types of projects 'cause it's so all encompassing for me
that I can only focus on making this the best that it can be.
And then we'll see what happens with my own personal life.
