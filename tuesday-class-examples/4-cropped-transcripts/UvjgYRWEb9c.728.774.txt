to make a difference there.
- I looked on the Vegas odds.
You guys are top four or
five contender Vegas wise
to win a championship.
- Absolutely, and that's
all you can do every year.
You know, let me give you an example.
All you can do is put
together a great team
and hope to be one of the
top four or five teams
to have a chance at a championship.
Because after that it's luck.
Okay, look at the great.
- A little injury.
- Absolutely, look at the
great Golden State Warriors,
okay, the greatest team
ever in the last five years.
How many championships did they win
in the last five years?
- Was it two or three?
- Three, three, and they lost two.
Okay, so no matter how good you are,
it still takes some luck.
So my deal is with my team is,
we're gonna set ourselves up
to be one of the better teams
every year and let's
hope we get some luck.
And maybe I get some and maybe I don't.
