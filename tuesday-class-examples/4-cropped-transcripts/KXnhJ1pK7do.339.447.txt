so just know your arm know how long it
takes for you to get ready and no like
figure out when you're in bed and you
hear that first alarm at 6 15 you're
like that's my glam alarm but you know
what I'm too tired for this
I'm just gonna wait for my next alarm
and do my everyday makeup look
and then when that everyday makeup alarm
comes on your light you know what I have
a science test today I'm going to get a
little bit more sleep so then you wake
up at your natural makeup alarm and then
you get up you know how long it takes
you to get ready because you already
have this planned out and then you just
do your thing and you get to school
so basically what I'm saying is have
your morning routine down to a tee
before school starts you know how long
it takes you know your routine
I have like three different routines
like i said i have my glam when every
day and my natural
so I that's my plan you do whatever is
great for you but I'm just saying you
need to have your nighttime 30 min
routine and your morning routine down so
that getting ready in the morning and
getting ready for bed is really quick
and easy for you
another thing is I know that when I was
a starting freshman
I was super nervous about going to
school because I was like oh my gosh
look at those senior and junior girls
they look so old they're so pretty yadda
yadda yadda
and I'm coming in here and i look like
i'm five I look like a child
I still feel like I look like a child
sometimes but that's it that's anyways
but you just gotta remember that those
screws were in your shoes - they know
what it's like to be a freshman so
they're not
I mean I just say do you
and also when you look at those older
girls and you feel like oh I could never
