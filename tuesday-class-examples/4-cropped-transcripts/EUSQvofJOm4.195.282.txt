So this where we gon' close out like this.
I'm gonna try and arrange,
I'm gon' do my best to
get the conversations
that need to be had between
you and these people
so you can hear from them.
I'm gonna then ask them
would they say it publicly
for the benefit of
everybody so you can get
the release that you need.
Then I'm gonna ask you
to tell these people,
and apologize for some bashing you done.
I know you don't think you
did nothin' but you did
and when everybody can come to that,
then I think that's a
chance for us to move.
I love you Mo.
I'm glad you came to see me.
Looking back on it, I
should've picked up the phone
and called you more readily.
- I appreciate that.
- I probably should've done that.
- Thank you.
- Just lookin' on it, that's
probably what I should've did.
- That's all I wanted.
- But I didn't, so now I'm here
and moving forward as your big brother.
I just wanna help you Mo.
I swear to God, I didn't
come here to bash you.
I love you, I wish you well.
And let's heal this thing and move forward
so the world can see how great we all are.
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up!
The one, the only, that damn Mo'nique!
- No damn Mo'nique.
I'll punch you all up in your gut!
(cheering)
- I love you baby.
(cheering)
Hey everybody, want you to catch our--
where's she going?
I want to catch up with her
to see her at the SLS in Las Vegas.
We'll be right back.
(jazzy music)
