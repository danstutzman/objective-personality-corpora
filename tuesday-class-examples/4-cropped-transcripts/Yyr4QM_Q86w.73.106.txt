ambitious and got off to a rocky start
but some were a little offended by a
remark you made when you first landed
here about the lack of great chefs in
this city
Toronto's not considered one of the top
five food cities in the world and you
can sit and complain about it all you
want or we can try to get to a point
where it's objectively true and that's
sort of what I meant is this Toronto
restaurant wrong with Luka living up to
your expectations for it we had some
rough patches but it's better than it's
ever been and I think that everybody's
really proud of what we do okay so
there's a menu for tonight they want to
