called
rub it against mine for good luck Billy
that's how you do it these are the
tricks of the trade can you just tell me
what we're making already because I'm a
biology's we're gonna be making we're
gonna be making deviled eggs oh yeah not
just any deviled eggs
just remotes deviled egg smoked okay you
get it Lou step one in making deviled
eggs is to boil them
I think stuff want us to ask your host
if she's interested in making them
mm that's kind of step one for everybody
right yep luckily I love them look the
first ingredient is eggs baby take these
eggs oh we have to boil them that one
bro
oh shit ski yeah and I didn't even do it
and we touch anything yet for all you
people watching I didn't touch a thing
so once we're done boiling we have to
put the eggs into like a nice fat that's
how I like to do it because it makes the
shells come off oh those are so smart
Wow I'm learning a lot today yeah that's
right it's it's that's right guys we
have a nice time and we're nice people
don't you oh yeah you know I always feel
like I just you just look morbid like
you look like you could be more of it
that's the ice bath Wow oh I love toast
I love it dad our new toast
I haven't had toast since like I would
probably rise in kindergarten
we're gonna take our eggs one by one and
gently let how do we lift them out of
there um do you have a slotted spoon
with it without a slotted spoon that's a
mashed potato masher I bet you this will
work okay well why don't we just hold
okay oh what's that it yeah okay let me
hardly take help okay very good so we
give our eggs a little judge in their
ice bath if you want you can this is how
you cook Josey by the way people don't
people always skip this part but like
you just stick your fingers and then you
just twirl and that's that's real
cooking right there I think they're good
my lap and now we peel the eggs from
their shells
oh are you okay
it's like humpty-dumpty that guy you
know yeah I know he's always been that
way
so this is you peel the eggs hmm okay so
I'll lie that I'll go to lay that egg
yes right there just like a chicken
beautiful do that six more times
um what are we doing we're we're mixing
up the ingredients to put on top of the
deviled egg yolk we are we need a mixing
bowl why don't you just use that ashtray
music/song yeah which which one it's
very popular it's hard to man now that
you've detailed all of your eggs you're
good
you know editing is have to have the
comedy for this show so thank you for
explaining television - oh God boo-boo
so now we're gonna split the egg in half
good luck on that surface I was hoping
for your assistance
okay okay there we go and
[Music]
Wow Wow see fresh all right nope that's
the opposite I thought we were trying
different cuts it's not like steak or
you can do different cuts of beef I was
gonna do this
oh my this was medium rare these are
pretty these eggs so gently gently
remove the yolk oh okay okay go away
this is not gonna go well
so okay can you don't move the bowl
though there you go boo boo and the best
you can
fresh okay okay it makes me emotional to
see sometimes to think about it you know
the next step and making our eggs is to
take all the ingredients that we have
over there and put them into here those
ingredients include mustard pepper Bob
is it way there it is salt
apple cider vinegar habanero oh oh fuck
that was a lot
Boston at least mayonnaise did you know
