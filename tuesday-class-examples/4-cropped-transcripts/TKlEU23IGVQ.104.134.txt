energy I'm just I'm just enjoying me
right but I just in terms of is this the
way you wanted it to work out this is
how I envisioned everything this is how
I've seen it for me I've always kind of
um being ready for fame I've always
prepared for it because a lot of people
were in my position get thrust into the
spotlight and then they're just like
deer in the headlights they don't know
how to act or what's doing yeah you see
them get built up they rise and in the
world just watches them fall I've seen
in entertainment and sports yes in this
you know in this game and
I don't want to be another bad statistic
