like say Michael Jordan played against
no one and the NBA in the end all here's
the thing man at the end of the day
we're he and I always say the end of the
day our goal and our mission magic Spurs
everybody is to win championships that's
it I don't care how you get there I
don't care what you do to get there I
don't care if you got to pick up a team
and cap I don't care what you do don't
care if the yell at everything doesn't
matter the goal is to win
