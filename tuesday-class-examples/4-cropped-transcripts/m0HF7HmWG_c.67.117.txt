universe lisa is a devoted and
protective parent on her list of
priorities
her son is at the top I literally when
he was a baby would write down data like
results from a from a lab I would write
down you know the time of day you know
his bottle had a bottle drink 4.2 ounces
milk you know and then half hour later
pooped slept from this time to this time
and then just so I can die I almost
started a graph but then I got so nutty
with it that I started averaging out
getting you know like I started getting
you know I mean you know ounces of milk
per day I mean I'm hours of sleep per
day poops
is there any relationship to how much he
eats no I mean I got really nutty
