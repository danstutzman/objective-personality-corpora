- Yeah.
- Yeah.
There was alcohol
at that wedding.
- I--yeah, but I'm okay.
I remember every conversation
whether I've had
18 drinks or none,
because I'm always intoxicated
to some degree.
- Really?
- Yeah, so it's just--
People are like,
"How do you remember that?"
'Cause that's how
I am all the time.
I remember things that people
don't think I remember.
- Are you drunk right now?
- No, I'm actually very sober.
- Do you want--
you look angry about it.
[audience laughter]
- Don't know how this happened.
- Why are you sober?
You should--
This is the time
to start drinking.
- I'm a professional.
I know you don't want me
to show up here drunk.
- You can do whatever--
- I would never do that.
- Well, you were drunk on
the series that you did.
Let's talk--let's talk about
the docuseries.
Okay, so, it's on Netflix,
and it's four different
subjects,
and tell everybody
what the subjects are.
- Marriage, racism,
Silicon Valley and drugs.
- And I learned, also like you,
it's "Silicon,"
not "Silicone."
- Yeah.
- Silicon Valley.
I was saying it wrong.
He's like--
This guy in Silicon Valley was
like, "You're saying it--
That's a breast augmentation."
And I'm like,
"No, I know what that is."
He goes, "Yeah, but these are
two different things."
I'm like, "Oh, I thought that's
where 'Silicone' Valley
came from."
Was like--
[audience laughter]
Like the silicone
they put in boobs.
And he's like, "No, not at all.
There's no connection
whatsoever."
- Well, I didn't think that,
but I did think
it was pronounced "silicone,"
but anyway.
It's really, really funny,
and really informative,
as I texted you the other night,
and said how much I liked it.
You're so clever.
You're so quick with everybody.
And you really are genuinely
delving into
these subject matters
with genuine interest, and we
all learn something from it.
Like the marriage thing,
I learned
that you may want
to get married now.
- Well, now that I've--
now that I've got past the point
where everyone wants you to get
married, when you're 20 and 30,
and like, every guy you date,
they're like,
"Are you gonna marry him?
Are you gonna marry him?"
I'm like, "I hope not.
I hope I don't marry this guy."
And now that I'm past the age
and that I turned 40,
and nobody's asking me
to get married,
now I'm open to it.
- I see.
[audience laughter]
- Now that I have no viable,
like, prospects.
I'm not dating anybody.
Now I could actually
see myself doing it.
just as like, kind of like,
"Yeah, look at me now,
rebel without a cause."
[audience laughter]
- Is it that you want
what you can't have?
Like, when you had all
these opportunities,
and now you're thinking,
"Now I want it
because I don't have it."
- No, I think I'm going to
do it out of rebellion.
I don't like when anybody tells
me to conform to any idea.
So the idea of getting married
to me, it's just so--
it's too predictable,
so I wanted to not do it,
and now that I've aced that,
I'd like to maybe do it.
- Because it's not
predictable at all,
because nobody would
think you'd get married.
You have--I know a few of
the guys that you've dated,
and they're, like,
very different.
Is there something that they
all kind of have in common?
Like, what's your type?
- I don't think I have a type.
Obviously, with my history,
I don't have a type,
but I love--I do love men.
I mean, I really like them
a lot.
- Oh, I know.
[audience laughter]
- And I like--you know, just
there are so many out there,
I mean, and there are
so many to sample.
That's why I never want
to get pigeonholed.
[audience laughter]
There are just so many
possibilities.
Do you know what I'm saying?
- I do.
