This was the secret that you planned to keep
hidden in the drawer forever.
Mel: Yeah I was not going to tell anybody
because it was stupid and it also worked so
it was my thing and it’s not your thing.
See the real thing that happened for me and
this is something that is a really important
topic for me, is that there is when you talk
about personality so extroverts, introverts
a lot of us really I know I did this I was
all wrong about what confidence meant.
I thought confidence was a personality trait.
Tom: I love this tell me more.
Mel: I thought that people that are outgoing
are the confident ones and the truth is confidence
is not a personality trait at all, it’s
a skill.
A lot of the extroverted people that you know
are actually very insecure, I used to become
of them.
I used to be the kind of bossy class loud
mouth; that didn’t believe in myself, that
didn’t believe in my ideas, that didn’t
have the confidence and the courage to really
be the real me; who I am, who I’m not flaws
and all.
There are tremendous number of introverted
people that feel uncomfortable putting the
attention on themselves, but they are very,
very confident in their ideas.
They definitely believe in themselves.
When you start to separate confidence not
as a matter of personality but as a skill
that you can acquire because confidence is
the ability to move in my opinion from thought
to action.
Because when you are a confident person you
believe enough in yourself and your capability
that you are willing to try, that you are
willing to share.
To me confidence isn’t the assuredness that
it turns out, it’s the willingness to try
