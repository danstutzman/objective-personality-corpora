Kane: Uh, Eugene, what's the meeting about today?
The meeting today is with my core production team.
We're gonna go over the basic breakdown of the entire video
How the crane that we're renting is going to move about the space.
It is of utmost importance to make sure that the way that I shotlist this is going to be to the T
Perfectly timed, perfectly choreographed. Every shot should mean something.
From the camera, to the set, to the producing.
We all have to be in complete agreement about how to deliver the best message in the most efficient way.
And the way that he sees things is so specific to him
Even though he has honestly the most detailed shotlist, treatments, with crazy references
It's still impossible to really know what's going on in his head or how he's envisioning it
Until you're literally on set seeing it.
Every single time I feel like I know what's going on or like how it's suppose to look.
And then I get on set, I'm like, "Oh. I get it now."
